If you want to get the most out of your home this spring and summer, start the process now with these five home-prep tips:

**1\. Clear debris from your yard.** This includes the dead leaves left over from last fall and any plants that didn't survive the Wisconsin winter.

**2\. Clean gutters and downspouts.** Make sure that everything is draining properly and no moisture is pooling around your home’s foundation.

**3\. Check your windows.** Do you have any fogged seals? I can refer you to a great company that can fix it up. You want as much spring and summer sunshine as possible in your home, especially when buyers are seeing it.

**4\. Prepare for grilling season.** Clean your grill, wash outdoor furniture, and even stain your deck. Whether you’re hosting a barbecue or a buyer, you’ll be ready to go.

**5\. Ensure your HVAC system is working properly.** You don’t want to wait until it’s too late to notice something is wrong. If you don't already follow a regular maintenance schedule for this system, today’s a great day to start.

If you have questions about these tips or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
