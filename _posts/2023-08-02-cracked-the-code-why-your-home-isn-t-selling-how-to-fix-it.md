If you're a homeowner who is having difficulty selling, know that you're not alone. Fortunately, there are ways to combat this issue, and we're here today to talk about that. Here are the top three reasons why your home may not be selling and what to do about them.

**1\. Pricing problems.** Many homeowners price their homes too high in hopes that it will leave room for negotiation. However, this may turn buyers away and cost you money in the end. Today's buyers are getting smarter, so listen to the feedback you receive during open houses and showings. In many cases, the common problem is the price. Consider lowering your price based on comparable homes, and our team can help you do that appropriately.

**2\. Product problems.** Pay attention to the feedback you receive after open houses and showings. There may be renovations or updates you need to make. Sometimes, simple decluttering can make your home appear more spacious. Additionally, staging your home correctly, including curb appeal, decorations, and paint, can make a huge difference.

**3\. Marketing problems.** Your home won't sell if buyers don't even hear about it. Work with a great agent like our team, who has top-notch marketing plans. Most consumers start their search online, so ensure you have an excellent online listing. Also, collaborate with someone who knows how to get your listing seen by the most people possible, including through multiple social media channels.
