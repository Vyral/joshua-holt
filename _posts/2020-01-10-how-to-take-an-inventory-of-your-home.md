As a homeowner, it’s very important that you do an inventory of the possessions in your home in the event that something catastrophic happens to it, like a fire. There’s no time like the present to do this.&nbsp;

Could you name the make, model, and price of all the TVs you own? Do you know where all the jewelry, trinkets, or collectibles are and how much they’re worth? This kind of thing can add up if something catastrophic does happen to your home, and it’s definitely something you don’t want to deal with.&nbsp;

That being said, I have two main tips for you to remember when doing your home inventory. &nbsp;

First, **use your smartphone to go room by room and take pictures and video of every important item you want to catalog.**&nbsp;

After you’re done doing that, **use a cloud-based service to upload and store your photos and video.** In my opinion, Google Drive works best for this. If you already have a Google account, then it’s free. It has quite a bit of storage, and you can also utilize Google Spreadsheet to further itemize your possessions.&nbsp;

Like I said, the last thing you want to do in the event of a home disaster is to try to remember all the items you owned and estimate what they were worth.&nbsp;
