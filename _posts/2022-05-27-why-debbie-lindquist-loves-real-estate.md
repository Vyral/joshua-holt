Today I’m joined by Debbie Lindquist, a recent addition to our team as one of our sales partners. We’re excited to have her on our team, so we wanted to take some time and introduce her to you all.&nbsp;

**What did you do before real estate?**

I had the important job of being a stay-at-home mom for eight years before I started working in real estate. Before that, I worked at a bank.

**You got into real estate six years ago. How did you connect with Keller Williams?**

I interviewed for an admin position for an agent here at KW. After my interview, I decided that I wouldn’t be happy sitting at a desk and doing paperwork; I could do that anywhere. My heart was more in real estate and helping people, so I decided to get my license and become an agent.

**Why did you decide to join a team?&nbsp;**

I’ve been a solo agent for quite a long time, and it was a roller coaster. It was difficult, and I realized that I needed the support a team could give me. Even when I was on vacation, I was sitting in a hotel room, writing offers. I was never truly off of the job.

Joining a team has been awesome, and I love having the support. I think I was always meant to be on a team, so I probably should’ve done it a while ago.

**I definitely feel like teams are the direction real estate is headed. What do you think?**

I agree, and that fact had something to do with my decision to join a team as well. I could see that the market was changing, and I didn’t want to be left behind. As a solo agent, I wanted to be part of a group of people who have the same passion for real estate that I do.

**What do you hope to accomplish with your clients?**

The most important thing to me is that my clients trust me and know that I have their back. They’re not just a number to me. I really care for them, and I want to help them succeed and be where they want to be. I want to meet great people and become friends with them. The goal at the end of the day is to have great relationships and help people.

**What’s the best way to get in touch with you?&nbsp;**

If you want to work with me, you can give me a call at (608) 216-8933 or email me at [debbielind@kw.com](mailto:debbielind@kw.com). I’m also on social media, just search for my name and contact me. You can also get a hold of Josh and let him know that you want to work with me.&nbsp;

You can reach out to our team directly anytime at (608) 345-6594. We look forward to the opportunity to help more people as we grow our team, so if you or someone you know is looking to buy or sell, we’d love the opportunity to meet them and see if we’d be a good match.
