Our team recently had the opportunity to tour the Respite Center at RISE Wisconsin. We learned all about the work they’re doing to provide emotional support and emergency care for local families in need.

It really resonated with us. We work with families every day with the focus of changing their lives through homeownership. Through our work, we’ve found that many families out there can benefit from organizations like RISE Wisconsin and their Respite Center. **We’re proud to announce that we have partnered with RISE Wisconsin to make their Respite Center in Madison our official nonprofit for 2022.**

This center provides emergency childcare and respite for children ages zero to 14 as well as parents support and crisis counseling seven days a week. This center also helps parents and caregivers access important resources to support and stabilize their families.

We wanted to partner with an organization that is making a great local impact but might not be getting much shine. Helping families in need and providing emotional support and care for the youth in our area directly aligns with our core values.

**Every time someone buys, sells, or invests in real estate with our team, we will give a portion of our profits to the Respite Center.** Our goal is not only to raise awareness for this great organization, but we want to raise a total of $10,000 for the center in 2022.

If you have any questions about the Respite Center, buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
