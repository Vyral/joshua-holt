Jonathan Gaspero is joining our team as an agent, and we wanted to introduce him to all of you. Here’s a quick Q&A with him so you can get to know him better:

**What is your background from before you got into real estate?**

Before real estate, I worked at Meredith Hospital. I was originally pursuing a career in healthcare administration and management, but I found my love for real estate and decided to give it a shot.

**What got you connected to Keller Williams?**

I had a good friend, David Perry, who got me into real estate. He kept trying to push me and get me to join his team, but I had other career goals at the time. It sounded like something I wanted to do, but it just wasn't the right time. By the time I finally got my real estate license, he had moved to Las Vegas, but he said to check out Keller Williams.

**What made you decide that joining our team was the right route to take?**

It was the support aspect of the team because I’d never done real estate before.

**What are you hoping to accomplish when working with a client?**

I want to help them as best I can and provide the best service by responding quickly, being personable, and listening to their needs.

**What's the best way for a client to reach you?**

Feel free to reach out to me through Facebook or by phone or text at (608) 852-5656.

You can reach our team directly at any time by phone at (608) 345-6594. You can also email any of us if you have questions. Please also check out our Facebook and Instagram. We look forward to the opportunity to help more people as we continue to grow our team.&nbsp;

If you or somebody you know is looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate in the greater Madison and South Central Wisconsin area, we'd love the opportunity to meet and see if we're a good match to help you achieve your goals.
