We're incredibly grateful to all of our clients who supported our team and chose us to help them with their real estate needs this year. At the beginning of the year we announced the Respite Center at RISE Wisconsin as our official non-profit partner and set a goal to donate $10,000 by contributing a portion of our profits from each closing\!

We are thrilled to announce that we were able to meet that goal and were able to present RISE Wisconsin with our donation check\! We know the money raised will go a long way to help this wonderful organization.

We are enthused to say we are continuing to partner with this amazing organization in 2023\!
