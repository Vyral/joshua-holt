What are the best places to get ice cream in the Madison area? Today, I have my definitive top five list for you, starting with an honorable mention:

**Sassy Cow.** Sassy Cow is a family-owned dairy farm renowned for its high-quality artisanal dairy products. They offer a variety of delicious locally produced goods, including milk, cheese, and ice cream—all made from the milk of their herd of cows. If you ever visit, you can tour the farm and facilities, sample the products, and learn about the dairy production process.

Now, on to our top five ice cream shops in Madison:

**Number Five: Chocolate Shop Ice Cream.** This shop has been in business since 1962 and has built a reputation for crafting high-quality, creamy ice cream using fresh ingredients. They offer unique and classic flavors, including signature creations and seasonal specialties. The ice cream is made in small batches to ensure consistency and flavor depth. They have several shops around town; you can get it at many other businesses. When in season, my favorite flavor from them is lemon meringue; otherwise, I'm a big fan of Oreo.

**Number Four: Babcock Hall Ice Cream.** Located on the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus and operated by the Department of Dairy Science, Babcock Hall Ice Cream is crafted using milk from the university's dairy herd, ensuring freshness and superior flavor. Visitors can enjoy a variety of classic and inventive flavors, and the facility also serves as a valuable educational resource, offering insights into dairy science and production. If you're ever here, I recommend getting the Union Utopia.

**Number Three: Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt.** Yes, I know it's not technically ice cream, but who doesn't love adding a ton of toppings to your favorite flavor—or flavors? If you've never been, I highly recommend trying it out. The shop features a variety of self-serve frozen yogurt flavors and a wide selection of fresh, high-quality toppings, allowing customers to create unique combinations with options like dairy-free and low-fat yogurts. When there, I always go for the cookies and cream and load on the toppings.

**Number Two: Good News Ice Cream.** Good News Ice Cream is a boutique ice cream shop known for its artisanal approach and unique flavor. The shop emphasizes high-quality, locally sourced ingredients and creates its ice cream in small batches to ensure freshness and rich taste. With a focus on innovation, Good News Ice Cream frequently introduces inventive flavors and seasonal specials, catering to various tastes and dietary preferences. It also has a great location downtown next to the Capitol. My favorite flavor from there is blueberry honey lavender.

**Number One: Paradise Ice Cream.** Paradise Ice Cream Shop offers a delightful escape with its vast array of premium flavors. Known for its commitment to quality and creativity, the shop serves classic favorites and innovative seasonal flavors from fresh, high-quality ingredients. You can find all of your favorite sweet and salty Mexican treats here. It's seriously the best in the city. Make sure you get the Mangonada when you're here.
