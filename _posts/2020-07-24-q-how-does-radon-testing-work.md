I’ve recently had some clients ask me questions about radon. They want to know how you test for it, what it is, and what to do if you do have high levels of radon. **We’re going to cover all of that information today.**

Radon is a cancer-causing, radioactive gas. The problem is that it’s tasteless, odorless, and invisible, but you can test for it. **The Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer today behind smoking.&nbsp;**

In Wisconsin, the action level for high radon is a level of 4.0 pCi/L or higher. That aligns with the EPA guidelines. The action level is not a safe level, however, as there are no safe levels of radon gas.&nbsp;

**Testing is the only way to know your home’s radon levels.** There are no immediate symptoms that will alert you of the presence of radon. It typically takes years of exposure before any problems surface. If you’re dealing with a real estate transaction, your home inspector can typically also perform a radon test and get your results within a few days.

If you’re a homeowner who didn’t include a radon testing contingency when you made the offer on the home and you're curious about the levels, **there are many DIY testing kits that you can buy for under $20.&nbsp;**

If you do have high radon, you can fix the problem. It’s best to rely on a professional, especially&nbsp; when dealing with something this dangerous. The presence of radon gas can be remediated with the installation of a radon mitigation system. These systems vent the radon gas from below the basement floor in your home and use a fan to expel the gas. These systems typically cost between $700 and $1,500 to install in your home.

If you have questions for me about testing for radon or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
