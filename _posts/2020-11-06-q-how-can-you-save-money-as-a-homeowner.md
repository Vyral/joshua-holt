Even if you’re not planning on selling your home anytime soon, here are four ways you can save money as a homeowner right now:

**1\. Reach out to your insurance agent.** Most homeowners simply renew their initial homeowners insurance policy every time it comes up for renewal without examining it to see how they can save money. They also sometimes forget to ensure that they have an adequate amount of coverage for their home. I suggest reaching out to your agent to see how you can save money with your current policy. You can also reach out to me and I’d be happy to discuss how our service, Keller Covered, can save you money on your homeowners insurance premiums.&nbsp;

**2\. Install a smart thermostat.** These products have been around for a while now, and they’ve only gotten better at programming the preferred climate in your home. They’ve also been proven to help you save money on your monthly utility bills, so this is definitely something you should look into as we get closer to winter.&nbsp;

**3\. Get a home warranty.** I know what you may be thinking: *“Josh, isn’t that an expense?”* While there is a cost to having a home warranty (usually a few hundred dollars), it covers many big-ticket repair items. If something breaks in your air conditioning, plumbing, or electrical system, having that repair cost covered will save you a substantial amount of money.

**4\. Get a home inspection.** Getting a home inspection is something people usually do when they buy a home, but getting a home inspection *after* you own the home is beneficial, too. The inspector can evaluate areas of your home you might be unaware of and spot some much-needed repairs. This way, you can fix them before they become a much bigger issue down the road.&nbsp;

Of course, if you need recommendations for service providers who can help with these tips, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to show you our list of service providers and help you save money.&nbsp;
