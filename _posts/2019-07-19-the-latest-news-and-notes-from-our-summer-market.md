What’s the latest news on our Dane County market and beyond? &nbsp;

Much like the last few months and years, we’re seeing a scarcity of inventory in certain segments of our market. Conditions continue to bode well for sellers, but we’re also seeing some changes that may signal greater opportunities for buyers.&nbsp;

Recently, Dane County has seen an uptick in the number of homes on the market, both in terms of single-family homes and condos: 1,000 single-family properties and 225 condos are currently listed.&nbsp;

Another recent development is **homes are spending more time on the market.** For single-family homes, the average days on market is 67 days, and the average condo is sitting on the market for a little over 120 days. &nbsp;

I’m constantly being asked about inventory and justifiably so. The amount of inventory we have is a prime indicator of whether we’re in a seller’s market, a buyer’s market, or a balanced market. We’re firmly in a seller’s market at the moment, and though our inventory situation is showing modest signs of going the opposite direction or toward a balanced state, we’re still nowhere near where we’d like to be. &nbsp;

In the up-to-$200,000 price point, we have just 0.85 months’ worth of inventory, which means homes priced around there are flying off the market. When we move up to the $200,000 to $350,000 range, inventory is slightly higher with 1.4 months’ worth. Inventory doubles in the $350,000 to $500,000 range, and rises still in the luxury market to 5.3 months’ worth.&nbsp;

**As for median sales price, single-family homes are selling for $319,000 right now.** Contrast that with the median price for these homes in the spring, which was $300,000. The median sale price for condos has slightly increased to $200,000.&nbsp;

Now, I know not everyone lives in or is focused on the numbers for Dane County, so I’d also like to share a quick update on the larger South Central Wisconsin region. Let’s quickly run through the numbers:&nbsp;

* Regional inventory is at 2.8 months’ worth
* Regional median sales price for single-family homes has fallen a bit to $232,000
* Regional median sales price for condos is at about $190,000&nbsp;

Lastly and surprisingly, our interest rates are still unbelievably low: They’re currently sub-4% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Even as home prices increase, **it’s still a great time to get into a new home and secure an interest rate in the low-4% range. &nbsp;&nbsp;**

**If you’re a seller who’s looking to move up, our current market is rife with opportunities to do so.** You’ll find that conditions are favorable to sell your home, and the availability of homes provides more flexibility for you as a buyer as well.&nbsp;
