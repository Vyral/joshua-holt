When someone buys a used car, they want to make sure that it’s in good condition. Most of these buyers try to look for a certified vehicle, which essentially means the car is reliable. Homebuyers are the same way—they want to be sure their purchase isn’t going to be full of expensive surprises.&nbsp;

**This is why we offer a certified home program that helps sellers get their homes pre-inspected, repaired, and even appraised in some circumstances.** On top of all this, we also include a comprehensive home warranty that gives buyers an even greater peace of mind.

For sellers, getting a home certified means clearing up the issues that could cause a sale to fall through. Something may pop up during the buyer’s inspection or appraisal, so this gives you a chance to address these problems early on and prevent them from derailing your transaction.

**If you’d like to learn more about our certified home program and how it can help you as a seller, feel free to reach out to us.** We’d also be happy to answer any questions you may have about the process. Until then, we look forward to hearing from you soon.
