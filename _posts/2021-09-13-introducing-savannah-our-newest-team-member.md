Today I’m joined by Savannah Paukner, a new executive assistant for our team. I want to take a second to introduce her because if you decide to buy or sell with our team, you’ll probably be working with Savannah a lot.&nbsp;

**So Savannah, what was your background before real estate?**

Before, my family and I were in Fort Leonard in Missouri while my husband finished his career in the Air Force. I was working for the government in the purchasing field, and before that, I worked in the county’s treasury department. I was doing back-end support work for the most part, so I have plenty of experience working with a lot of moving parts.&nbsp;

**I know your family just moved to Wisconsin a few months ago, so what made you want to get into real estate?**

As you already know, when my family moved to Wisconsin, we worked with your team to buy a home. Even long-distance, the experience was fantastic, so when I saw you had a job opening, I saw it as a sign of a great opportunity.&nbsp;

**What is your role here, and how will you interact with our clients?**

Right now, I’m taking all the back-end support off the agents’ plates. If there’s any paperwork, appointments, or correspondence between agents and clients, I’ll be the one making sure everything is in order. In other words, I’ll be making sure our team fulfills our promise to give our clients the best experience possible.&nbsp;

We’re all thrilled here at the Holt Real Estate Team to have Savannah on our team, and we’re especially excited for our clients to work with her. All of us are dedicated to providing you with the best service possible, so if you are looking to buy or sell a home, please give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help.
