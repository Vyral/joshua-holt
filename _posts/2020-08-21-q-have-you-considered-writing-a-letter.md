Are you considering buying a home in this extremely hot real estate market? These days, we’re frequently seeing multiple offers on properties, and it can be stressful for all parties involved. We have one particular tip we give our buyers that often helps them win the house of their dreams.&nbsp;

**Consider writing a love letter to the seller about why you want to buy the house** and what features you love. This will help your offer stand out amongst the competition. This letter should be written by you, the buyer, not the real estate agent. When a seller is comparing lots of offers, your letter is something different for them to consider. It may touch them emotionally and make them take a closer look at the rest of your offer.&nbsp;

Let us know via phone or email if you’re interested in making a move or have any other questions. We would love to share all of our other tips and tricks with you that have helped our buyers win.
