If you’re a homeowner who expects trick-or-treaters to come to your door, here are a few safety tips to keep in mind this year:

**1\. Keep your walkways and/or porch well-lit.** That way, kids and their parents can reach your door safely.

**2\. Keep your pets out of sight.** Pets can often get stressed out by seeing so many strangers come to the door. Put them in another room to reduce their stress and prevent them from scaring anyone.

**3\. Park your cars in the garage, if possible.** That ensures your trick-or-treaters will have enough room to get to your front door.

**4\. Use flameless LED candles in your jack-o’-lanterns instead of real candles.** This eliminates the fire hazard that burning candles presents.

On the other hand, if you’re planning to go out into the neighborhood and trick or treat, here are a few points to follow:

**1\. Stick to neighborhoods with sidewalks.** It usually gets dark around that time, so finding areas with sidewalks means that you won’t have to walk in the streets. It might be a good idea to put reflective tape on your kids’ jackets or costumes to make sure that cars can see them.

**2\. Keep to the crosswalks.** Don’t just dart across the road to get to the next home; if you or your children are wearing dark costumes, it might be hard for oncoming cars to see them.

**3\. Carry a flashlight with you.** Some driveways might be long and dark, so having a flashlight can come in handy.

**4\. Remind your kids not to enter a stranger’s home.** Have them stay on the front porch and in full view.

**5\. Be mindful of the treats your kids receive**. You never know—someone might put a food item in their bag that your kids are allergic to, or they might slip in something that isn’t necessarily appropriate. Comb through the candy before letting them eat it.

We hope you and yours have a safe, fun, and happy Halloween\!
