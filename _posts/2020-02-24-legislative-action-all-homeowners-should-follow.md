Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to go to our state capitol building for the annual Realtor and Government Day. Today, I’m sharing my experience by recapping the three main topics discussed at the event, as well as sharing my insight on these matters.&nbsp;

**Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to skip to topics that interest you most:&nbsp;**

1:29 - The issue of riparian water rights (2018 supreme court case regarding homeowners’ right to build a pier)

3:33 - Legislation in the works prohibiting the habit of “chasing sales”&nbsp;

4:45 - The lack of workforce housing in our area and proposed remedies

&nbsp;6:20 - Wrapping things up&nbsp;

If you’re interested in discussing these important topics in more detail, please feel free to reach out by phone or email. I’d love the opportunity to inform the homeowners in our great state and gain different perspectives on these issues.&nbsp;
