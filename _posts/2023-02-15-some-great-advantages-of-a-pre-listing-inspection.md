Today we are excited to bring you some important information about the benefits of pre-listing inspections from Phil Jackson from WISCo Inspections. We will talk about some of the reasons you should consider a pre-inspection when you're getting ready to list your home.

One of the biggest advantages is that it gives the sellers a true representation of their homes. Since the sellers have been in their homes for a while, they may overlook some things that are truly big issues. **Sellers need to know the true condition of their homes.**&nbsp;

Once you know the condition, you can decide what you want to fix. If there’s something you don’t want to fix, be upfront and disclose it at the beginning. Then you can avoid some negotiations because buyers know what they’re getting into.

Some buyers will waive the inspection later on if there has been a pre-listing inspection, and some will bring more money to the table. In addition, **pre-listing inspections can help you avoid legal trouble.** Then the inspector is on the hook if something wasn’t discovered or disclosed, not you.&nbsp;

Know that there is no such thing as a perfect home. **All sellers need to know the true condition of their home so they can choose the right price.** Condition is one of the biggest factors when determining the price, so more knowledge helps you get off on the right foot and become more likely to fit into your ideal timeline.&nbsp;
