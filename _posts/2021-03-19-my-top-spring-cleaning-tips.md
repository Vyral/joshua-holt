Whether you’re thinking about listing your home for sale this spring or you’re already in your forever home, these spring cleaning tips can be of value to any homeowner:&nbsp;

**1\. Windows.** Make sure that you take time to clean not only the outsides of your windows but also the insides; buyers will check out both.&nbsp;

**2\. Curb appeal.** Walk around the perimeter of your home and tackle any areas that need to be cleaned, trimmed, or repainted. Oftentimes, you’ll find debris and buildup leftover from winter. Also, take a look at your front door—has it seen better days? A fresh coat of paint could bring it back to life.&nbsp;

When was the last time you truly looked at the address numbers on your house? Straighten them if they’re misaligned and make sure they’re not faded. While you’re at it, test your exterior lights to make sure everything is in working order.&nbsp;

**3\. Kitchen.** This is easily the top priority inside your home. Focus on your appliances; do a good refrigerator and freezer clean-out, run a clean cycle on the dishwasher, etc. The kitchen receives a lot of traffic, so it should receive some extra attention when cleaning.&nbsp;

**4\. Bathrooms.** No one likes deep cleaning toilets, sinks, and tile floors, but it’s a must. If you have fabric shower curtains, run those through a gentle wash cycle. Or, if yours are older shower curtains, perhaps it’s time to replace them.&nbsp;
