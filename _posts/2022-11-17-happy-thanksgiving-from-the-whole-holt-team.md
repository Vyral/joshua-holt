During this amazing and special time of year, I wanted to take a few moments to share a message of thanks and gratitude from me and my team. **We are so grateful for everybody that has trusted us with the opportunity to help with their real estate needs.** Whether that is buying, selling, or investing, we just want to say thank you. You’ve given us the great privilege of helping more families than ever before in 2022.

Each member of our team is grateful for you and for their own special blessings during this time of year. We are grateful for food and family, friends, and time to decompress. We are thankful for our health, careers, football, and the opportunity to help those in need. Finally, we have so much to be grateful for in our pets and in seeing our families after the long pandemic.

**So, from all of us here at the Holt Team, happy holidays and happy Thanksgiving.** If you need help with anything, don’t forget to call or email us. We’d love to hear from you.
