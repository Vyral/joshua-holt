The spring real estate market has already arrived in Madison. If you’re thinking about buying or selling a home this year, there are certain things you must know, and I want to talk about them with you today.

**If you’re a seller, it’s all about having a plan.** It’s still challenging to buy with a home sale contingency, so you’d likely need to buy your next house before selling the current one.&nbsp;

Consider utilizing our certified home program, which includes a pre-inspection. That will alert you to any potential problems with the home before you list and motivate buyers to get top dollar.

**As for buyers, a full pre-approval letter from a local lender is a great place to start.** Don’t think you can get away with a letter from an online lender. Also, make sure you’re focused on the monthly payment you desire, not the home’s sticker price.

Another tip for buyers is to bring your A-game. You need to make the best offer possible, and you’ll likely have to offer above the list price while waiving contingencies. This will be uncomfortable, but it’s what you have to do to win these days.

You’re going to lose out to other buyers, but don’t lose hope. When you finally win a great home, you’ll be so happy that you stayed the course.

If you have any questions for me about buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
