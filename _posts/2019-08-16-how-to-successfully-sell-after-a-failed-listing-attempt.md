There’s a common misconception among sellers (and even some real estate agents) that all it takes to sell a home is to stick a sign in the yard and wait for the offers to roll in. However, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Many sellers who attempt this route end up with expired listings.&nbsp;

So what do you do after this has happened to you? What does it take to make your second attempt at listing successful?

First, it’s important to realize that you’re not alone. **Last year in Dane County, 10.68% of single-family home listings and 6.46% of all condo listings expired.&nbsp;**

But why?

There are actually a number of factors that can contribute to a listing’s success (or its failure). Chief among these factors are price, condition, and location, but also marketing. **The marketing an agent uses to advertise a home can make or break its ability to sell.&nbsp;**

An effective marketing plan must include professional photography (and videography), an enticing description on its online listing, and adequate exposure. Your agent should use every available method to reach buyers, including social media advertising, print advertising, open houses, among other things.&nbsp;

Proactive prospecting, in particular, is critical. In other words, your agent needs to actively seek out buyers, rather than waiting for buyers to come to them.&nbsp;

**If the agent you’re working with can’t do these things for you and your home, then it’s time to seek out a more experienced, knowledgeable professional.** Our team would be happy to fill that role for you. So, if you or someone you know is looking to sell, please reach out to us. We can help you sell quickly and for top dollar, within a time frame that works for you.&nbsp;
