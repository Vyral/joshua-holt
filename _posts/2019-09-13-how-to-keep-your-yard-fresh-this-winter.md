The other day, I was speaking with a friend of mine about their yard and gave them some advice about what they can do to make sure it stays in tip-top shape through the fall and winter as they prepare for a possible spring sale. **Here are eight helpful tips that you can use to keep your yard in good shape:**

**1\. &nbsp;Fertilization and weed control.** This helps reduce the stress your lawn will endure over the summer, and weed control will take care of those fall weeds as well.&nbsp;

**2\. Aerate your yard. It should be overseeded as well.** Aeration prepares it for winter and promotes healthy growth for spring. Overseeding helps fill in any bare spots and helps your lawn recover from the summer.

**3\. Rake and pick up leaves.** This will reduce possible insect and disease damage over the winter. It’s also a good time to remove any dead or unsafe branches in your yard.

**4\. The final mow of the season.** Set your mower to the lowest height recommended for your grass on the last mow of the year to reduce the ability of diseases to affect them in the winter.

**5\. Plant trees and shrubs.** In the fall, it gives roots a chance to establish in a lower-stress, moist environment.

**6\. Cut back and divide perennials.** This will result in a more established plant next spring.

**7\. Add some fall color.** Hearty mums are a great choice.

**8\. Plant spring bulbs.** To ensure vibrant, early spring color in your landscaping, be sure to plant your bulbs in the fall.

If you have any questions for me about these tips or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
