Did you know that only 15% of black households own their homes? Today we are honored to be joined by Tiffany Malone, co-creator of Own It: Building Black Wealth, to find out more about the program and how they are helping close this tremendous gap.&nbsp;

Own It is a movement designed to address racial disparities in real estate through a strong collaboration of community and business partnerships. **Although discrimination in housing is no longer legal, echoes from the past and access to money remain some of black families’ biggest barriers.**

Tiffany grew up in a single-family household and was surrounded by lots of people who had homes when her parents did not. At a young age, she saw what homeownership could do regarding wealth and how it set people apart.

The program has two parts. One is an educational portion, and the other is a grant. **Once a participant completes the educational part, they can apply for $15,000 to buy a one- or two-unit home.** The home can be anywhere, but most people buy in the Madison area.
