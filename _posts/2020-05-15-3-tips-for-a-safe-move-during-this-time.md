Recently, several folks have asked me about how they can keep their families safe during the moving process right now. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, I have three tips for you to help make your move safe and healthy:

**1\. It's worth spending a bit of extra money.** The American Moving and Storage Association recommends passing on free, recycled boxes from supermarkets and liquor stores. Instead, get new moving boxes and packing tape. The reason is simple: Less chance of exposure to the virus. Stock up on adequate disinfectants and wipes for yourself, your moving truck, and any shared equipment you might be using.&nbsp;&nbsp;

If you can afford it and it makes sense for your situation, hire a company that will handle the move for you safely and strategically. Many moving companies currently provide virtual estimates and contactless moving, which reduces risk significantly.

**2\. Preparation is more important than ever.** A move often becomes a messy and disorganized affair. Now is the time to make it as neat as possible. Pack up everything and prepare it in advance of the actual move. By minimizing moving time, you're minimizing contact and exposure. If you're doing the move yourself, make sure to clean the truck and any shared moving bins or boxes. If you’re hiring a moving company, then spend the time to vet them. You’ll want to know what specific measures they’re using to deal with the pandemic—both with their equipment and their employees.&nbsp;

**3\. Respect the threat.** A move can be a frustrating experience. However, this is no time to throw caution to the wind and get careless. That means ongoing advice about social distancing, gloves, masks, and hygiene still applies. For example, if you are working with a moving company, make sure they have access to a sink with soap or hand sanitizer. Additionally, make sure to disinfect high-contact points such as doorknobs and countertops once the move is complete.

Moving isn’t always the most pleasant experience and this pandemic situation certainly doesn’t help, but it is possible to move safely in today’s market. If you have any questions about your move or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.
