If you’re considering selling your home, you need to know about staging and what it entails. Staging your home can help it sell for thousands of dollars more, so it’s worth the time and effort. To break down this important topic, we are here with Beth Linden-Johnson from Move-It Cleaning & Staging. She has been staging homes for our clients for years, and we are grateful to have her expertise.&nbsp;

Home staging is normally not like what you see on TV. In short, it’s the process of going through the home and getting it ready to sell, which includes activities like cleaning, decluttering, organizing, and getting the house ready for buyers to see it.

In the current housing market, homes are selling quickly, and for top dollar, so many people underestimate the power of staging. However, **it’s an important process because it will help your home appeal to a larger number of buyers, which will help you earn exponentially more.** In addition, your home needs to be depersonalized from how you had it when you lived there so buyers can envision themselves in the home, which is hard when the seller is still attached to the home. This is why we bring in a professional.&nbsp;

Beth’s approach to home staging is different than what you might see on TV. She focuses mainly on occupied home staging, which is when the owner is still living in the home. Therefore, she primarily works with furniture and decor. Sometimes she has to bring in some extra pieces, but she does use as much of the homeowner’s things as she can, as she believes that is a much more realistic approach. **She focuses on highlighting the home’s assets and creating focal points that will appeal to more people.**&nbsp;

To start the home staging process, Beth will begin with a consultation. Selling a home can be a very stressful process, so she tries to keep the whole process very low-key. In short, she just goes through the home with the owner and creates a list of things that need to be done in each room. She puts it all into a report that the homeowner can look back on and check things off as they do them. Also, she sometimes includes floorplans of how the furniture should be arranged.&nbsp;

The stats about home staging are always changing, but one thing that is always true is that **homes that are priced correctly and prepared well will sell for more money than those that aren’t.** Therefore, staging is very important, and it’s an inexpensive way to get a maximum return on your home investment. That’s why we work with Beth.&nbsp;
