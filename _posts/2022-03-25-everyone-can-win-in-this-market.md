We’ve all heard the terms seller’s market and buyer’s market before, but I think we’re currently in a different type of market altogether. What we’re in right now is a winner’s market. Typically, when you have less than six months of inventory, it’s a seller's market. In that kind of market, home values will appreciate because there’s not enough supply to meet demand. When we have more than six months of inventory, it’s a buyer’s market, and home values tend to depreciate. However, it’s a little more complicated than that right now.
