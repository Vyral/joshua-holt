# Welcome to the Holt Real Estate Team

I’m Joshua Holt, a licensed full-service REALTOR&reg; with ABR&reg; designation and founder of the Holt Real Estate Team. I work in partnership with Keller Williams Realty, representing buyers and sellers. I’ve proudly served our country, and now I proudly serve the communities throughout Stoughton, Madison, Edgerton, and Monona, Wisconsin, as well as the surrounding area. I love working with Keller Williams, the \#1 name in real estate. I’m a multiple graduate of their MAPS BOLD coaching course. I’m also honored to serve on my office’s Agent Leadership Council where I chair the technology committee.

### How it All Started

After high school I enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserves, where I honorably served for five years. While serving our country, I also obtained my degree in marketing and management with an emphasis on education. As I embarked on my professional life, I knew my true calling was a career in sales. I’ve held a variety of sales positions, first in retail and ultimately in sales leadership and training with a Fortune 100 firm. With my roots in education and training, real estate proved to be a natural fit.

### Community First

My family and I are long-term residents of Stoughton, where I serve on the Board of Directors with our Chamber of Commerce. I am also a proud board member of our local American Legion Post and am an avid supporter of our local schools through sponsorship and time in the classroom.

Stoughton is a city I love dearly and the “birthplace of the coffee break,” as many locals amusingly profess. Stoughton straddles Highway 51 and the gorgeous Yahara River, all just 20 minutes from Madison. While it’s mainly a suburban bedroom community, it bears a significant impact on Dane County’s economy.

### Why Choose Me As Your Agent?

Meeting new people and helping clients find the right house to call home is our passion- no matter if that house is move in ready or could stand to use some updating\!

Our client dedication, strong customer-focused mentality, education first process and genuine love of helping others to meet their real estate goals are what motivates us the most. If you’re relocating to the greater Madison, WI area, searching for a new home to accommodate your growing (or empty nest\!) needs, or moving on to a new city and to your next phase of life, I hope to have the opportunity to get to know you and guide you through all of the important steps involved in a real estate transaction.
