# Welcome to the Holt Real Estate Team

I’m Joshua Holt, a licensed full-service REALTOR&reg; and Broker and Founder of the Holt Real Estate Team. I work in partnership with Keller Williams Realty, representing buyers and sellers. I’ve proudly served our country, and now I proudly serve the communities throughout Dane County and South Central Wisconsin. I love working with Keller Williams, the \#1 name in real estate. I strongly believe in having a growth mindset which is why I invest in weekly coaching with our MAPS coaching division as well as being a multiple time graduate of their BOLD coaching course. I’m honored to serve on our office’s Agent Leadership Council as well as being a member of both the KW Military and KW Relocation divisions.

### How it All Started

After high school I enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserves, where I honorably served for five years. While serving our country, I also obtained my degree in marketing and management with an emphasis on education. As I embarked on my professional life, I knew my true calling was a career in sales. I’ve held a variety of sales positions, first in retail and ultimately in sales leadership and training with a Fortune 100 firm. With my roots in education and training, real estate proved to be a natural fit.

### Community First

My family and I are long-term residents of Stoughton, where I serve on the Board of Directors with our Chamber of Commerce. I am also a proud board member of our local American Legion Post and am an avid supporter of our local schools through sponsorship and time in the classroom.

Stoughton is a city I love dearly and the “birthplace of the coffee break,” as many locals amusingly profess. Stoughton straddles Highway 51 and the gorgeous Yahara River, all just 20 minutes from Madison. While it’s mainly a suburban bedroom community, it bears a significant impact on Dane County’s economy.
