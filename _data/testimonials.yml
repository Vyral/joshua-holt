Once I decided on a home he assisted me with the facts I needed to make an accepted offer.

    name: Beth and Tony (Buyer)

  - quote: I was renting out a condo that I owned in Stoughton, when my renters decided not to renew their lease I decided it was time to sell my investment property! Originally I had wanted to use a flat fee service and do the majority of the work myself, it was the best way to make the most profit – but when Josh messaged me and asked if I would meet with him I figured it was worth a shot – I know NOTHING about real estate! When we met, he came prepared with lots of paperwork including comparible properties in the area that had sold and a print out showing me the potential profit based on the sale price. The best thing Josh did was provide proof of comparible sales, because he recommended that I list $15,000 MORE than I was intending to list. My property was vacant – Josh held 3 open houses the first weekend it was listed and I accepted an offer of $1500 OVER list price ($16,500 over what I was planning to list at) on the 4th day it was on the market.

  - quote: Joshua was amazingly flexible for my wife and me. He was supportive to us and caring for our needs as parents of a 9-month old. Would recommend him to anyone!
    name: Dan and Lauren (Buyer)

  - quote: My wife and I bought a home in Jefferson which is farther out from the Madison area, and we felt like Joshua worked with us just as diligently as he would have with anyone else. He was fast to reply and communicate through our entire purchasing process, and was extremely relatable. I  would 100% recommend him as a buying agent to anyone looking for a new home!
    name: Andy and Sarah (Buyer)

  - quote: When I was searching for a new place to live in June, I happened to be put in the capable hands of Joshua at Keller Williams. I was panicked and didn’t have much money to buy a place and he constantly reassured me about how he would do anything to help me find a place or with anything I’d need. The very first day I went looking for a Condo with Joshua, I wanted to see a number of places but figured Joshua had other appointments and would never have time to show me different places. But, I was wrong for Joshua took me to every place I wanted to see and even back to a place we already looked at just to make sure. Well, the place we saw again was what I could afford and we made an offer on it. We even made a lower offer to see if it would be accepted. It was accepted and the ball was rolling. I was then getting more nervous each day as the offer was accepted. Frequently I would get a reassuring call from Joshua calming my fears about finances.
    name: Sally (Buyer)

  - quote: Josh was fantastic. Knowledgeable, helpful, and insightful. I feel bad for anyone who hasn’t bought a home with him.

    name: September (Buyer)

  - quote: When my husband and I started talking about buying a house I wanted to work with a realtor that I could trust and I immediately thought of Josh Holt. Josh is an amazing realtor. When buying your first home everyone makes the process look so easy from finding the perfect home to getting financing. But that is not at all the experience we had. I think we hit about every bump in the road but Josh was amazing through this process from keeping us posted via phone call or text message to just being there for moral support. Josh was also awesome about meeting on our time. My husband works 2 retail jobs so finding time to meet with Josh sometimes had to be scheduled out and he was so good about getting times that worked for us and working them into his schedule even if it was a phone call while he was driving home at night. No doubt if we decide to sell our house and find a new one we are going with Josh again!!
    name: Bridget (Buyer)

  - quote: Joshua Holt was an amazing realtor. We worked with him as buyers in 2017 and sellers in 2020. He helped us purchase a beautiful condo for our family in 2017, and then helped us to sell it in 2020 as a result of moving out of state. Throughout the whole process Joshua was excellent at prioritizing us and our needs as a family in our home search, quick to get back to us and our questions, flexible in showing us homes on the weekend/evenings, and overall just a great, experienced realtor who knew the process of buying and selling a home inside and out! We highly recommend him as a realtor - you will not regret working with him!
    name: Lauren (Seller)

  - quote: Josh Holt made my home buying experience truly stress free amidst all of the choices we had. We were between buying and building and he used ALL of his resources to ensure we were fully informed and all of our needs were met. He was so kind and accommodating and truly worked at all hours for us, as I’m sure he does for all of his clients. He’s veteran friendly with a lot of knowledge regarding VA Home Loans, and definitely knows his market overall. I could not have been more pleased. Thank you Josh!!!
    name: Alyson (Buyer)

  - quote: We interviewed a lot of realtors and we actually started with someone else however that didn't work out. We called up Josh and he was more than happy to take on our home sale as well as ensure that we didn't have another experience like our last one. He talked us through everything when we got forms or documents and even wanted to meet in person to go over different things. That helped us feel more comfortable throughout the whole process. He would check in every once and awhile just to see how we were and if we had any questions. He also went above and beyond and checked to ensure that our house was safe and secure when we were gone on vacation. We would recommend Josh to anyone trying to sell a house, he's great!!
    name: Amber & Corey (Seller)

  - quote: Joshua was available during the morning, afternoon, and evening any day of the week. This was helpful to us when we have questions at any time of day. He was always personable, professional, and caring. We appreciated Joshua's expert opinion as we navigated selling a home with him in record time. We trust him entirely and that is why we returned to Joshua to sell the home he helped us buy just a few years earlier- he's awesome!
    name: Dan (Seller)

  - quote: Josh is an amazing Realtor! I had several questions about the property I was going to buy and thought I would have to do a ton of my own research. Josh was amazing and did all the work for me! I would highly recommend Josh as your next Realtor. You will not be dissapointed!
