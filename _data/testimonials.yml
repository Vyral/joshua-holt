  - quote: It's been 16 years since I last purchased a home.  Joshua was wonderful to work with. He explained the local market and assisted me with finding homes that met my needs.  Once I decided on a home he assisted me with the facts I needed to make an accepted offer. His network of professionals  included bankers, home inspectors, etc. I was extremely pleased with his professionalism and would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone looking to buy or sell a home.

    name: Beth and Tony - Buyer

  - quote: I was renting out a condo that I owned in Stoughton, when my renters decided not to renew their lease I decided it was time to sell my investment property! Originally I had wanted to use a flat fee service and do the majority of the work myself, it was the best way to make the most profit – but when Josh messaged me and asked if I would meet with him I figured it was worth a shot – I know NOTHING about real estate! When we met, he came prepared with lots of paperwork including comparible properties in the area that had sold and a print out showing me the potential profit based on the sale price. The best thing Josh did was provide proof of comparible sales, because he recommended that I list $15,000 MORE than I was intending to list. My property was vacant – Josh held 3 open houses the first weekend it was listed and I accepted an offer of $1500 OVER list price ($16,500 over what I was planning to list at) on the 4th day it was on the market (I wanted to wait until each open house was done)! I knew the market was great for sellers, but I didn’t know it was THAT great! It’s a great thing I decided to meet with Josh and that Josh knew his stuff or I really could have undersold my property! In addition to the above – between the accepted offer and the closing date, since my property was vacant, Josh made trips over to help maintain and make sure everything was going ok and looking good. The sale process was so easy that I started to believe it was too good to be true (based on past experiences with buying/selling) and was worrying WAY too much. Everything went through without a hitch and on time. I was VERY happy and so thankful for all that Josh did for me during the process. Couldn’t have done it without you, Josh, thank you SO much!

  - quote: Joshua was amazingly flexible for my wife and me. He was supportive to us and caring for our needs as parents of a 9-month old. Would recommend him to anyone!
    name: Dan and Lauren - Buyer

  - quote: My wife and I bought a home in Jefferson which is farther out from the Madison area, and we felt like Joshua worked with us just as diligently as he would have with anyone else. He was fast to reply and communicate through our entire purchasing process, and was extremely relatable. I  would 100% recommend him as a buying agent to anyone looking for a new home!

  - quote: When I was searching for a new place to live in June, I happened to be put in the capable hands of Joshua at Keller Williams. I was panicked and didn’t have much money to buy a place and he constantly reassured me about how he would do anything to help me find a place or with anything I’d need. The very first day I went looking for a Condo with Joshua, I wanted to see a number of places but figured Joshua had other appointments and would never have time to show me different places. But, I was wrong for Joshua took me to every place I wanted to see and even back to a place we already looked at just to make sure. Well, the place we saw again was what I could afford and we made an offer on it. We even made a lower offer to see if it would be accepted. It was accepted and the ball was rolling. I was then getting more nervous each day as the offer was accepted. Frequently I would get a reassuring call from Joshua calming my fears about finances and wanting to know if there was anything I needed. He was also very helpful about finding moving help, (which, by the way, included him offering to help me) I’ve never found or heard of a Realtor helping me move. I thought he was kidding, but on the hottest, most sticky day of June he was ready to go and helped me move my things in a big truck. I was completely grateful and was never charged a penny for the help. If I had to move again, I would choose Keller Williams and I highly recommend Joshua Holt with Keller Williams for his support and dedication to making my whole experience run smoothly from beginning to end.
