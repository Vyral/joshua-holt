        "content": "As youâre aware, thereâs been a lot of talk in the news lately about the coronavirus, and many people have reached out to me wondering how this will impact our real estate market.Â Â When we try to predict what will happen in our local market, whether itâs due to the coronavirus or any other factor, we look to whatâs happening on our nationâs coasts, meaning markets like Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco. These are good leading indicators of trends that will eventually impact our market. When we see a shift in the luxury markets out on the coast, thatâs something weâll probably see in South Central Wisconsin sooner rather than later.Â âIf your home is valued above that or the $500,000 mark, I recommend listing it sooner rather than later.âWhether youâre buying or selling, if youâre concerned about the coronavirusâ impact on our market, my first piece of advice is to reach out to me. We can talk about your goals and formulate a strategy to accomplish them.Â If youâre a seller, one thing we do know is that the median home price in Dane County is $285,000, so if your home is valued above that or the $500,000 mark, I recommend listing it sooner rather than later. We still have limited inventory and there are plenty of buyers, so strike while the iron is hot.Â On the flip side, because of the volatility weâre seeing in the stock market due to the coronavirus, mortgage rates remain lower than last year. This is making the biggest impact below the $285,000 price point. Inventory is already tight in this market, and low interest rates will bring out more buyers and increase competition.Â What we donât want to see happen is sellers thinking now is a great time to raise prices, because that might not play out how you imagine it. Like I said, I recommend first giving me a call so we can find out what your home is worth, make a plan, and capture the attention of all the buyers out there taking advantage of these low interest rates.Â Moving forward, weâll keep an eye on this situation. If you have any questions about this topic at all, donât hesitate to call or email me. Iâm here to help.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Joe Long of Guild Mortgage joins me today to dispel some common market misconceptions and share his perspective from the lending side of things.Â Whatâs going to happen with the market in 2020 and beyond? Many homeowners remember losing value in their homes from 2008 to 2012, but since 2013 home values have been recovering. Since homes have been appreciating for so long, many believe itâs time for a market correction.Â Itâs important to understand that the market fundamentals we have now are different than the ones we had back then. Just because the marketâs been appreciating for a while doesnât mean thereâs something wrong or properties will start losing value. From 2005 to 2008, we saw rapid appreciation that was unsustainableâprices rose as high as 10% per year. Historically, home values in Dane County appreciate 3% to 4% per year. Thatâs sustainable, so if homes keep appreciating at that rate, theyâll outpace inflation and, theoretically, never cool down.Â âIf you bought a home and something were to go wrong, youâd be fine long-term.âAfter 2013, the pace of home value recovery increased rapidly, but now itâs slowing and weâre settling into a nice, pillowy landing. Last year, home values statewide rose about 5%, and this year theyâre predicted to rise between 3% and 4%. Some might see this slowdown as a bad thing, but this return to normalcy is a good thing.Â Based on the average prediction of where the marketâs headed in the next five years, if you purchased a $250,000 house now, it would appreciate by $47,500 by January 2025âa nice, slow pace.Â You need a place to live no matter what, and you can either pay your landlordâs rent or your mortgage. Only one of you is getting that appreciation, so you might as well take advantage of that equity. Many people lost a lot of money during the previous recession, but the No. 1 reason people buy houses isnât that itâs a financial investment but because they want to control where they live.Â Those who lost value starting in 2008 got it all back by 2017. If you bought a home and something were to go wrong, youâd be fine long-term. Youâll still pay off your mortgage and come out with a lot of equity. If nothing goes wrong, youâll come out way ahead.Â If you have any lending questions, feel free to give Joe a call at (608) 729-5379 or email him at jlong@guildmortgage.net.

        "content": "Iâm sure youâve heard a lot of buzz from people trying to predict when the next housing crash will be. While I do feel like thereâs a good chance that we may see a small recession or some little blips in the economy, there is also good evidence to suggest that we probably wonât see a housing crash like what happened in 2008.Â Unlike the last time that we did have a housing crash, credit has been tightened significantly. Lenders are doing their due diligence before approving home loans. The notorious subprime mortgages that helped spur the â08 crash are far from the norm in todayâs market.Â The median price in our area went up 6.4% over 2019 to $295,000, all due to a lack of inventory. Our inventory remains low because people that invest in new building projects simply arenât doing so as much. A lot of builders say they want to start on such projects, but lack the tradespeople needed to keep up with the high demand.Â âMortgage rates remain at near historic lows.âAnother reason why inventory is low boils down to demographics. A majority of the homeowners now are baby boomers, and theyâre simply holding onto their homes longer. This is squaring up directly against the millennial generation, which is primed to make the majority of home purchases in the nation. Not enough homes are available, so competition increases and prices follow suit.Â Mortgage rates remain at or near historic lows. To put this in perspective, pretend youâre in the market for a $250,000 home. If you wanted to maintain that same monthly payment that youâre budgeting for, but mortgage rates were to increase by even 1%, your buying power would be reduced to about $220,000. Move when it makes sense for your particular situation, but know that itâs always wise to take advantage of really low rates.Â If youâre trying to time your purchase by waiting for the next supposed crash, the chances are high that youâre going to miss out on opportunities. Is there a perfect time to buy or sell a home? Objectively, maybe or maybe not. Subjectively, the right time is whenever you decide.Â So if youâre ready to buy or sell real estate here in the Madison area, Iâd love a chance to talk to you. Give a call or shoot me an email so we can discuss how I can help you achieve your goals for 2020.",

Â âThe last thing you want to do in the event of a home disaster is try to remember all the items you owned and estimate what they were worth.âFirst, use your smartphone to go room by room and take pictures and video of every important item you want to catalog.Â After youâre done doing that, use a cloud-based service to upload and store your photos and video. In my opinion, Google Drive works best for this. If you already have a Google account, then itâs free.

If youâre like my family, now is the time you look to declutter your home as you prepare for the coming year, and Iâve got some tips to help you do that more easily today:1. Donât wait. Donât let weeks pass by as your holiday items sit in the home without a proper place. I recommend getting on the task of decluttering right away.2. Prioritize. If youâre struggling to find a place for one or more items that you have, consider whether the items are something that you need to hold on to. There may be certain items that are important to you and your family, but there may also be other items that youâve acquired over the years that you donât really use in your annual decorating. If thatâs the case, it might be time to donate or resell those items.âA lot of your extra gift wrap and trimmings are recyclable.â3. Organize gift wrap. It can be very easy for rolls of gift wrap to get spread out and take up a lot of room. Now is a great time to go through and organize that gift wrap to make sure youâre not holding on to scraps of paper that wonât help you in the future. Maybe you could repurpose those for a craft project or something else.4. Recycle. Make sure that youâre not just tossing all of your extra gift wrap and trimmings in the trash. A lot of this stuff is recycled material and you want to properly dispose of it according to your local recycling priorities.5. Prepare for next year. You may have things that you kept in storage and didnât pull out for the holidays. I like to take this time of year to evaluate the inventory I have and see if any of them are ones I intend to hold onto in the future. Itâs also just a good time to organize your stuff so that you know where everyone is.Â If you have any questions for me about this list or real estate in general, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Recently someone approached me to ask whether buying an investment property before buying their first primary residence was a good idea, and, actually, it very well may be. Here are five reasons why:Â 1. Interest rates are low. Low interest rates mean greater purchasing power, which gives those looking to invest a unique opportunity to enjoy low monthly payments on their property.Â 2. Homes are continuing to appreciate each year. According to Core Logicâs value index, home values have increased every year for the past seven years. And, according to most experts, real estate is one of the safest (and wisest) investments.âIf you ever tire of renting your property out, or if youâre simply ready to become a homeowner, yourself, there is always the option for you to move into the home.â3. Real estate investing creates passive income. Beyond just having someone else cover the expense of your monthly payments, renting out a property means that you can rely on your investment to generate passive income, as well.Â 4. Short-term rentals are popular right now. Even if you arenât interested in being a long-term landlord, short-term rentals are in high demand right now. Airbnb and VRBO have opened up numerous options for investors. Your investment property also doesnât need to be local. You can purchase a rental property in a tourist âhot spotâ and have someone else manage it for you.Â 5. You can turn the investment into your primary residence later on. If you ever tire of renting your property out, or if youâre simply ready to become a homeowner, yourself, there is always the option for you to move into the home.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

With fall color and produce back in season, you might be tempted to load up your house with both. However, if you plan to sell your home this fall, you might want to exercise some restraint. In the eyes of buyers, less is more. Here are four tips to consider:Â 1. Pay attention to your fall-themed curb appeal. While too many fall decorations can distract attention away from your homeâs best features, a few tasteful accents can produce an inviting atmosphere. Take the time to rake and round up fallen leaves and do general yard care. Buyers may give you a pass if they see your lawn is blanketed with leaves, but that doesnât mean your home will make a good impression.Â âWhile too many fall decorations can distract attention away from your homeâs best features, a few tasteful accents can produce an inviting atmosphere.â2. Go easy on the gory Halloween decorations. Decorating your home with fake blood, guts, and skeletons might just be part of getting into the holiday spirit for you, but you never know what kind of reaction youâll get from buyers. Some may be amused, but some may be frightened, and anything that has the potential to turn off a buyer is a no-no when listing your home. Play it safe with your decor choices, so you can appeal to the masses.Â 3. Let in the light. Itâs always a good idea to pull back the curtains and allow natural light to help you showcase your home. With shorter days in the fall and winter, you want to make sure you maximize the amount of light flooding into your home. This way, your home will appear larger.Â 4. Make the space inviting. As the weather cools off, a warm and cozy atmosphere will give buyers a warm and cozy feeling. Place plush throws on your couch and beds and add fall-accented pillows to your couch and chairs as well.Â If you have any questions about selling your home or about real estate in general, or thereâs a topic youâd like me to cover in a future video, feel free to give me a call at 608-345-6594 or you can email me at JDHolt@KW.com.

Here are eight helpful tips that you can use to keep your yard in good shape:1. Â Fertilization and weed control. This helps reduce the stress your lawn will endure over the summer, and weed control will take care of those fall weeds as well.Â 2. Aerate your yard. It should be overseeded as well. Aeration prepares it for winter and promotes healthy growth for spring. Overseeding helps fill in any bare spots and helps your lawn recover from the summer.3. Rake and pick up leaves. This will reduce possible insect and disease damage over the winter. Itâs also a good time to remove any dead or unsafe branches in your yard.âRoots have a better chance to establish in the fall.â4. The final mow of the season. Set your mower to the lowest height recommended for your grass on the last mow of the year to reduce the ability of diseases to affect them in the winter.5. Plant trees and shrubs. In the fall, it gives roots a chance to establish in a lower-stress, moist environment.6. Cut back and divide perennials. This will result in a more established plant next spring.7. Add some fall color. Hearty mums are a great choice.8. Plant spring bulbs. To ensure vibrant, early spring color in your landscaping, be sure to plant your bulbs in the fall.If you have any questions for me about these tips or about anything else related to real estate, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "To be honest, purchasing new construction isnât all that different from purchasing an existing home in an established neighborhood. Of course, for either purchase, thereâs a lot of value that having the support of a professional agent can bring you when making such an important (and expensive) decision.If you visited a model home on the weekend and talked to the on-site sales agent, you likely wouldnât be talking to an agent who had your best interests at heart. What I mean by that is that particular agent is likely employed by or represents the builder and their fiduciary responsibility is to them.When you hire an agent of your own, you get the advocacy of someone who does have your best interests at heart and who will help you navigate the intricacies of negotiation, paperwork, terms, conditions, and every other aspect of the real estate process in order to ensure that youâre getting the best benefits from your purchase.For example, builders may offer discounts, savings, or incentives if you work with their lender or select specific upgrades and finishes; as agents in your corner, weâll make sure that those incentives truly are savings and wonât come back to bite you later on.âAs agents in your corner, weâll make sure that the builderâs incentives truly are savings and wonât come back to bite you later on.âSomething else to take into consideration is how long you plan to live in the home. If, for whatever reason, this home ends up not being your forever home and you decide to resell it later on,Â your agent can also advise you on which upgrades you can do to increase your future resale value and which ones may actually decrease or not improve that value.One of the biggest things an agent on your side can help you with isÂ researching the builder: how they work, the quality of their products, their building programs, the incentives they offer, and their sales history.And finally,Â it typically doesnât cost you any extra money to hire an agent like myself to represent you.Â Like any seller in a real estate transaction, the builder will be the one who ends up paying for your agentâs commission. If youâre not working with an agent, donât assume they will just pass that difference on to you as cost savings, often they may use that money instead for marketing or just for profit. Iâve found that most of the builders in our market are âagent-friendlyâ and like working with buyers that have representation; the key thing is that we, the agents, need to be the ones who introduce you to the builder, not the other way around. If you have more questions on that, send me a message and we can talk more.If you see value in having an agent like myself represent you in the purchase of a new construction property, and are looking to buy a brand-new home, reach out to us.

However, this couldnât be further from the truth. Many sellers who attempt this route end up with expired listings.So what do you do after this has happened to you? What does it take to make your second attempt at listing successful?First, itâs important to realize that youâre not alone. Year to Date in Dane County, 10.68% of single-family home listings and 6.46% of all condo listings expired.Â But why?There are actually a number of factors that can contribute to a listingâs success (or its failure). Chief among these factors are price, condition, and location, but also marketing. The marketing an agent uses to advertise a home can make or break its ability to sell.Â âYour agent needs to actively seek out buyers, rather than waiting for buyers to come to them.âAn effective marketing plan must include professional photography (and videography), an enticing description on its online listing, and adequate exposure. Your agent should use every available method to reach buyers, including social media advertising, print advertising, open houses, among other things.Â Proactive prospecting, in particular, is critical. In other words, your agent needs to actively seek out buyers, rather than waiting for buyers to come to them.Â If the agent youâre working with canât do these things for you and your home, then itâs time to seek out a more experienced, knowledgeable professional. Our team would be happy to fill that role for you. So, if you or someone you know is looking to sell, please reach out to us.

        "content": "Just the other day, a renter I know whoâs never been a homeowner asked me an interesting question: Is homeownership still one of the greatest ways to secure oneâs financial future? The answer is a resounding yes.Â When youâre stepping into the market to buy a home for the first time, itâs easy to fix your attention on price and what your monthly mortgage payment will be, and understandably so.Â Up to this point, youâve known exactly how much you were going to pay in rent each month, and now youâre trying to figure out how much house you can afford given your monthly budget.Beyond price and your monthly payment, itâs also important to think about the homeâs future value, or appreciation, over the life of your mortgage. When you sell your home, the majority of your profits will come from the equity youâve gained between the time you bought the home and the years youâve lived in the home.Â Although the market ebbs and flows and home values can ebb and flow with it, the value of real estate is always increasing, and thereâs no real indication that will change anytime soon.âThe sooner you start paying off your mortgage, the better your financial circumstances will be later in life.âAnother advantage of becoming a homeowner early in life is that, more than likely, youâll be able to pay off your mortgage during your working years. When you enter into retirement on a fixed income, having to continue paying on a mortgage can interfere with your ability to maintain your desired lifestyle. The sooner you start paying off your mortgage, the better your financial circumstances will be later in life.Finally, for those who struggle to save money, owning a home is a means by which you can achieve this. Think of it as a kind of forced savings. As a homeowner, youâll be forced to put away enough money to stay on top of your mortgage, cover your monthly expenses, and so on. All the while, your homeâs value will grow, and that equity will pay dividends when you sell it down the line.Â If you have any questions about our local market or real estate in general or if thereâs a topic youâd like me to cover in a future video, reach out to me by phone at 608-345-6594 or you can email me at JDHolt@KW.com.

The amount of inventory we have is a prime indicator of whether weâre in a sellerâs market, a buyerâs market, or a balanced market. Weâre firmly in a sellerâs market at the moment, and though our inventory situation is showing modest signs of going the opposite direction or toward a balanced state, weâre still nowhere near where weâd like to be. Â In the up-to-$200,000 price point, we have just 0.85 monthsâ worth of inventory, which means homes priced around there are flying off the market. When we move up to the $200,000 to $350,000 range, inventory is slightly higher with 1.4 monthsâ worth. Inventory doubles in the $350,000 to $500,000 range, and rises still in the luxury market to 5.3 monthsâ worth.Â âConditions continue to bode well for sellers, but weâre also seeing some changes that may signal greater opportunities for buyers.âAs for median sales price, single-family homes are selling for $319,000 right now. Contrast that with the median price for these homes in the spring, which was $300,000. The median sale price for condos has slightly increased to $200,000.Â Now, I know not everyone lives in or is focused on the numbers for Dane County, so letâs quickly run through the numbers for the larger South Central Wisconsin region:  Regional inventory is at 2.8 monthsâ worth  Regional median sales price for single-family homes has fallen a bit to $232,000  Regional median sales price for condos is at about $190,000Â Lastly and surprisingly, our interest rates are still unbelievably low: Theyâre currently sub-4% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Even as home prices increase, itâs still a great time to get into a new home and secure an interest rate in the low-4% range. Â Â If youâre a seller whoâs looking to move up, our current market is rife with opportunities to do so. Youâll find that conditions are favorable to sell your home, and the availability of homes provides more flexibility for you as a buyer as well.Â If you have any questions about the areaâs real estate market or if thereâs a topic youâd like me to feature on a future video, reach out to me by phone at 608-345-6594 or by email at JDHolt@KW.com.

        "content": "If you currently own a home and are thinking of selling it and buying a new one, you might be daunted by the process of juggling both transactions. Luckily, Iâm here to give you a few tips on how to navigate the process.First, talk to your lender. Before you even begin to look at homes, you should make sure that all of your finances are in order. Youâll want to ensure that nothing has changed in your financial picture that youâre not aware of and to figure out your options.Â âBefore you even begin to look at homes, you should make sure that all of your finances are in order.âThere are three ways to go about handling both these transactions at once:1. Sell your current home first. To do this, youâll need to list your home on the market at an appropriate price that you know will help it sell quickly. This can be an advantageous way to go about it, since a lot of sellers will be hesitant to accept an offer thatâs contingent on you selling your current home.Once you close on the sale of your current home, you could potentially do a rent-back agreement, in which the purchasers of your home agree to let you live there for a predetermined period of time for rent. This would allow you time to find and purchase a new home to move into.2. Buy your new home first. In this situation, you might be saddled with two concurrent mortgages, so it may not be ideal, depending on your financial situation.3. Buy and sell in the same day. It might be tricky, but it is possible to plan things in such a way that you can close on the sale of your current home and the purchase of your new home in the same day. Of course, this doesnât give you much time to move, so you may have to plan ahead.If you have any questions about todayâs topic or about the local real estate market, feel free to reach out to me.

        "content": "When youâre a home seller looking to create the best first impression on potential buyers, there are a number of different strategies to follow:1. Start by improving the curb appeal. Start from the street and work your way in. This includes looking at things like your driveway, the exterior landscaping, and the exterior of the home in general. Look at the outside of the property from a buyerâs perspective to make sure that it looks the best it possibly can. This way, when potential buyers drive or walk by the home, theyâll get the impression your home is well-maintained.2. Have a clean entryway. Make sure that your doormat is clean, your front door is freshly painted and presentable, and that your doorbell is in working order. The color of your door should complement your home, and if possible, the neighborhood at large.3. Eliminate any odors. You donât want potential buyers to walk into your home, only to be smacked in the face by the odor of pets, cigarette smoke, and even chemical smellsâbe careful to limit your use of deodorizers and fragrances, which can turn off potential buyers. The key when it comes to scent is balance.âBe careful to limit your use of deodorizers and fragrances, which can turn off potential buyers.â4. Deep clean the house. If you really want to create a great first impression, youâll need to take the time to deep clean your entire home, meaning you should clean the carpets, floors, and all other surfaces. And donât forget to dust! You donât want to give buyers the impression that youâre not maintaining your home as well as you could be. They may wonder if there are other areas youâre neglecting when it comes to home care.5. Declutter your home. You donât want to have various piles of your possessions lying around the home, especially if they take up floor space. Be sure to clean out and organize your storage areas, like your closets and cabinets. This is a good time to go through your things and purge those items you no longer need, want, or use. This will make your home seem neater and more accessible to a buyer.6. Repaint. Now, I donât mean that you need to repaint the entire exterior or interior of your home, although there are studies that show you can recoup one-and-a-half to two times your investment in your resale price if you do. What Iâm focusing on here, though, is making sure that youâve touched up any nicks, dings, or chips in your paint. Be sure to use a neutral color palette if you want to appeal to the widest pool of buyers!If youâre thinking about selling your home in todayâs market and you have any questions about what you can do to sell quickly and for top dollar, feel free to reach out to me.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Downsizing is the process of moving from a larger home to a smaller one. Why might people do this? As it turns out, there are many reasons:Most often, people downsize when there has been a life-changing occurrence, such as when the kids graduate and move away, or maybe youâre on the verge of retirement.Â It could also be that you just realize that managing a home of a certain size is more work, stress, and money than you can handle, and so a smaller home simply seems more feasible for you. This is especially true for elderly homeowners, and even for those who lead lifestyles that are simply too busy to allow them to juggle home maintenance with their lives.âIf youâre on a larger lot that requires continuous landscaping and maintenance, perhaps that means itâs time to look for something a little more manageable.âEspecially for those whose kids have moved away from home, another reason to downsize is the realization that you just have too much space that you donât use. That goes for the outside, as well; if youâre on a larger lot that requires continuous landscaping and maintenance, perhaps that means itâs time to look for something a little more manageable.Â Lastly, there are financial benefits to downsizing your home. If youâve lived in your home for a long time, youâve probably built up a fair amount of equity. Now could be the most opportune time to put your home on the market and make the move using the money you have tied up in the home.If you have any questions or comments about downsizing, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "title": "Selling on Your Own vs. Hiring a Real Estate Professional",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When youâre weighing the decision to hire a real estate professional to help you sell your home versus just doing it by yourself, there are four key points to keep in mind that will help you make your final decision about which route to go:1. Contracts and paperwork. Regardless of whoâs doing the selling, youâre still entering into a legally binding contract with the other party when you do sell it. If youâre not using a real estate professional to help you, youâll want to have a real estate attorney review the contracts for you so that you can be sure that your transaction is legally compliant.2. Marketing your home. The goal of most sellers is to get their listing in front of as many qualified buyersâ eyes as possible. In this day and age, you can do a lot on your own to give your listing exposure, particularly with social media. However, did you know that there are literally thousands of websites out there that real estate professionals post your listings to if you work with them? Chances are you donât have the time or resources to post to that many sites!âSelling a home is about more than just the dollars and centsâyou also need to think about the amount of time you have to dedicate to the logistics.â3. Pricing your home accurately. The reality is that you only have one shot to make a great initial impression. If you price your home too high when you first put it on the market, it will probably sit stagnant on the market, causing people to wonder whatâs wrong with it. Itâs a surefire way to reduce the amount of activity your home will see. The same is true if you price it too low. Many people like to go online to check home values, but thereâs really no better way to get the true value of your home than to talk to a real estate professional (like myself). We can do a comparative market analysis (CMA) to help you discern what people would be willing to pay for your home.4. The value of your time. A lot of folks donât always think of how much time it takes to sell a home. Regardless of whether you sell yours on your own or if you hire an agent, there are things youâll need to do in order to make sure the sale goes your way, like getting the property in show-ready condition. When you work with a real estate professional, theyâll handle all the particulars of the transaction for you, like scheduling showings and negotiating with the buyers and their agents. You likely have your own career to deal with, and you probably wonât be available when a buyer wants to see your home. Further still, we vet your buyers to make sure theyâre qualified to actually be able to purchase the home. Selling a home is about more than just the dollars and centsâyou also need to think about the amount of time you have to dedicate to the logistics.If you have any questions about todayâs topic or if youâre in need of a real estate professional to help you with your own home sale, feel free to give me a call or send an email.

        "title": "4 Buyer Tips for Navigating Our Current Market",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "These four tips will aid you in better navigating the current real estate market as a homebuyer:1. Consider submitting a larger earnest money deposit with your offer. There might not be an industry standard for this, but the earnest money is a good faith deposit that accompanies your offer and will speak volumes about your enthusiasm and seriousness about buying the property. By putting in a few thousand dollars extra, then, youâll let the seller know that youâre a strong and serious buyer.Â 2. Show the sellers that you are qualified to purchase their home. Probably most important of all, you need to show that youâve taken the steps to meet with a lender and not only get pre-qualified, but pre-approved as well. A pre-approval, again, solidly demonstrates that youâre a serious and able buyer. Â âPut your best foot forward when making your offer to the extent that youâre comfortable.â3. Give the sellers time to move and find out what terms are important to them. With good communication, your agent can help you with this. Whether the seller wants to have an expedient close and move-out or they need extra time, itâll look good if you can accommodate the timetable that works best for them.Â 4. Write your best offer! In this momentâs market, it wonât serve you well to write a lowball offer in the hopes that youâll negotiate higher. Instead of counting on the sellerâs willingness to negotiate and counter back, put your best foot forward when making your offer to the extent that youâre comfortable. In other words, decide how high youâre willing to go, so that if the home sold for more than that, youâd be comfortable walking away. Most sellers wonât have the appetite to go back and forth if another buyer sets themselves apart by making their best offer from the outset.Â If youâre looking to purchase a home in the Greater Madison area, Iâd be happy to help.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Thereâs not really a one-size-fits-all answer to the question, âHow is the market?â It depends on whether youâre looking to buy or sell, what your price point is, where youâre looking to live, and much more. These factors all play a part, so letâs see what the latest numbers have to say for each.In the Greater Dane County area, weâre expecting home prices to increase. Right now, the median price of a single-family home is $300,000, and condos are around $195,000.Inventory is illustrated in terms of how many months it would take for all currently listed homes to sell. Six months of inventory is a balanced market; anything above that is a buyerâs market, and anything below is a sellerâs market.Â âUltimately, itâs still a great market for buyers and sellers alike.âAs of now, we have an average of 1.5 monthsâ worth of inventory. Homes in the $200,000 price range only have two weeks of inventory. The $200,000 to $350,000 range has one month of inventory. At $350,000 to $500,000, there are 2.5 months of inventoryâthings tend to soften as price points increase. Over $500,000, there are 4.5 months of inventory.There are about 800 single-family homes currently on the market. On average, they take 87 days to sell. Interest rates are in the low 4% range for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, so ultimately, itâs still a great market for buyers and sellers alike.Making the most out of our market, however, depends on who you have working as your real estate professional.
