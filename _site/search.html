        "category": "",
        "content": "How to decide if you should try to time the market for a cheaper price. Are you waiting for prices to drop significantly before you buy a house? That is a common mentality nowadays, especially with interest rates as high as they are. No one can say exactly what will happen in the future, but many are hoping that values will crash so they can swoop in and buy properties for low prices. Should you wait to buy a house? Is it worth the risk?Â Some industry experts say the fluctuation in prices depends on the needs and goals of the particular area. A J.P. Morgan 2022 analysis of 116 metropolitan areas predicts housing prices to go in three general directions over the next couple of years. Some areas are predicted to drop 20% to 30%, some 10% to 15%, and some not at all.âWhat happens if you wait for a crash that never comes?âAgain, no one can say for sure what the future holds, but are you willing to take the risk of hoping that your area will be one of the few where prices fall? It is important to remember that many factors go into deciding prices, like interest rates, the state of the economy, the season of the year, etc. As a result, many experts believe it is not wise to wait for price decreases.Â People on this side of the debate say that trying to time the market to buy at the lowest possible point is often a foolâs game. The market changes often and quickly, so many are convinced that buying when itâs right for you and your family is the best choice. You never know when the peak is going to end, and you donât want to have any regrets. Hindsight is the only thing thatâs 20/20.Â The National Association of Home Buildersâ chief economist, Robert Dietz, says, âI think you want to be strategic and patientâpatience is different from waiting for a crash.â It is good to take the time to do your research and figure out your strategy, and buyers have more time to do that now as the market is shifting. However, that is different than waiting around for the market to crash to get the lowest price. If you do, you might miss your shot.This is a lot of information to take in, so if you have any questions or want to talk with me about your specific situation, donât hesitate to reach out. I would love to create a strategy with you that works best for you and your family. Call or email me anytime. I look forward to hearing from you.",

Today we are honored to be joined by Tiffany Malone, co-creator of Own It: Building Black Wealth, to find out more about the program and how they are helping close this tremendous gap.Â Own It is a movement designed to address racial disparities in real estate through a strong collaboration of community and business partnerships. Although discrimination in housing is no longer legal, echoes from the past and access to money remain some of black familiesâ biggest barriers.Tiffany grew up in a single-family household and was surrounded by lots of people who had homes when her parents did not. At a young age, she saw what homeownership could do regarding wealth and how it set people apart.âYou can help close the gap in housing opportunities.âThe program has two parts. One is an educational portion, and the other is a grant. Once a participant completes the educational part, they can apply for $15,000 to buy a one- or two-unit home. The home can be anywhere, but most people buy in the Madison area.If you would like to get involved, you can become an ambassador, volunteer, or donate.

        "content": "You can still get top dollar if you price your home correctly. If youâve been paying attention to housing market news, youâve probably heard about decreasing sales, rising interest rates, and increasing inventory. Do these factors mean weâre heading for a housing market crash? According to the experts, the answer is no. Instead of crashing, our housing market is correcting.Â During the crazy housing market caused by low interest rates and the increased flexibility of remote work, prices skyrocketed. In fact, the average home price increased by 10.2% from July 2021 to July 2022. The truth is that the crazy pandemic market wasnât sustainable. According to Moody Analytics, 210 metro areas were overvalued by 25% or more.Â If youâre looking to sell your home soon, what does this all mean for you? Fortunately, weâre still in a sellerâs market, but you have to be careful about how you price your home. If you make the wrong move, your house could sit on the market for a long time, and you may have to decrease your price.âWeâre still in a sellerâs market, but you have to be careful about how you price your home.âIn a correcting market like ours, it is more important than ever not to price your home too high. If you do, you could end up âchasing the market.â In this scenario, your initial price is too high, and buyers wonât look at your home. You could try lowering your price, but by that point, the market may have changed again. This is a sellerâs worst nightmareâif it happens, you may even have to take your property off the market and try again later.Â One strategy that works in a shifting market is to price your home slightly below market value on purpose. It seems odd, but this will guarantee that your home is the most attractive deal in your area. If everything goes according to plan, buyers will flock to your house, and the competition among them will naturally bring the price up to or above market value. The risk with this strategy is that if only a few buyers come to your home, there might not be enough competition to drive up the price. However, this is a fantastic option if you need to sell quickly.Â Of course, you can always work with a real estate professional to look at comparable sales in your area and find a goldilocks priceâone that isnât too high or too low, but just right. This can be difficult to do on your own in a correcting market, but professionals have access to market data that will make the process much easier.Â The bottom line is that sellers can still achieve fantastic results in this market as long as they do their research and price their homes correctly. If you would like to discuss which strategy might be best for you, donât hesitate to call or email me. Make it a great day!",

        "content": "Three types of homes that are selling and three that arenât. Our market shift is real and happening right now. So today I want to discuss the three types of properties in our market that are still selling well and three that arenât.The first kind of home thatâs still selling well is three- or four-bedroom, two-bath, single-family homes in above-average locations. The second one is condos that have at least two bedrooms. So whether they are more in the city center of Madison or out in the suburban areas, condos with two bedrooms or more are still selling well. The third type of property that are still selling well are entry-level homes in above-average locations. They sell even better when theyâve been remodeled or have had a refresh or update made to them.Many entry-level buyers donât necessarily have the funds to do updates to the home. If you have that type of home and can put those updates into it, those types of properties are going to do really well.âItâs very important that you get your pricing right from the get-go.âIf those homes are selling well, which ones arenât? The first category is entry-level homes in below-average locations, especially if they need a lot of work. The second type that are struggling are average homes in average locations. There isnât anything wrong with these homes, but higher interest rates make them less affordable for many buyers. That being said, the market for these types of houses fluctuates a lot. No other type is as sensitive to interest rate increases, so condition is crucial for these properties.Â Finally, overpriced homes are really struggling. Even a price 1% above market value can seriously reduce a homeâs marketability. Itâs very important that you get your pricing right from the get-go and youâre not chasing the market, or youâll struggle selling your home. The bottom line is that there is no longer a one-size-fits-all way to navigate this market, regardless of whether youâre a buyer or a seller.

However, depending on your situation, there will be times when buying before you sell is the better option. Whatever your reason, you should know that buying first comes with additional risks, such as paying two mortgages, if your current home takes a long time to sell.If youâre in a situation where you must buy first before selling, donât worry. Itâs not completely impossible, but it takes some strategic planning to make it happen. Here are two things you can do to help you buy before you sell:1. Make an offer with a home-sale contingency. By including a home-sale contingency in your offer, you can purchase the new house once your existing one sells successfully. If your current home doesnât sell within a certain time frame, you can cancel the purchase contract without any penalties. To sweeten the deal, your agent can explain to the seller that your house will likely sell fast in the current market.âBuying a new home before selling your existing one has its unique challenges.â2. Finance with a bridge loan. A bridge loan is a short-term, high-interest loan. When you buy with a bridge loan, you can use your existing home as collateral to get a loan for your new house. To close your bridge loan faster, try to align the closing dates of your buying and selling transactions.Buying a new home before selling your existing one has its unique challenges, but if you can leverage these options and utilize the guidance of an experienced agent, you can come up with the best solutions for your situation.

        "category": "",
        "content": "The future of our market is uncertain, but prices likely wonât fall. Are you worried about the future of our housing market? You arenât aloneâmany clients have reached out to ask me questions about where our market is heading. The truth is that no one knows for sure, but by looking at the latest statistics and trends, we can get a pretty good idea of what the future holds. Today I want to talk about where our real estate market is heading and what it means for you.Â So are we heading for a crash, a correction, or something else? First, none of the experts believe weâre heading for a crash, but Iâll talk more about that later. For a correction to occur, we would need to see a 10% decline in home values, according to Investopedia. Almost no markets around the country are experiencing that sort of decline, so we arenât in a correction either.Â The best way to describe our current market is that weâre at a turning point. No one knows what will happen for sure because weâve never seen a housing market like this before. Weâre coming out of an unprecedented pandemic; inflation is high, supply is low, and demand remains high. Although no one knows what comes next, it looks like sellers will continue to have the upper hand, at least in most markets.Â âNo experts believe weâre in a housing bubble or heading for a crash. âIf youâve heard on the news that our housing market is correcting, weâre in a housing bubble, or the market is about to collapse, donât worry. If you check out the chart at 2:11 in the video, youâll see that the average mortgage rate moves mostly in unison with the 10-year treasury yield. This means that when the Federal Reserve raises rates, it doesnât have a direct impact on your mortgage interest rate.As I said earlier, no experts believe weâre in a housing bubble or heading for a crash. Despite rising mortgage rates, we still have an extreme shortage of homes. Millennial buyers are still entering the market in large numbers, so demand will remain high even as rates rise. Mortgage rates will likely level off after the initial shock, and many buyers will reenter the market if this occurs.Â What about a recession? You may have heard in the news that the wider economy is heading for a recession, and that is probably true. However, a recession doesnât mean housing prices will drop. If you look at the chart at 4:23, youâll see that housing prices actually increased in four out of the last six recessions. The only significant outlier is the 2008 crash; however, our current market is very different from that one. The bottom line is that while a recession may be coming, our housing market will likely remain strong.Â If you have questions about todayâs topic or anything else, please call or email me.

        "title": "Will Rising Rates Cause Prices To Drop?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Hereâs the impact that rising interest rates will have on home prices.With the recent substantial increase in mortgage interest rates, many homeowners have been asking, âWill this finally cause home prices to drop?â The answer isnât cut and dry. In a market where rates are predicted to rise even further this year, buyer affordability could take a serious hit. To give you a better idea of whether your home is poised to lose value in the coming months, Iâm going to address four key points that explain whatâs happening to buyers in the real estate market and what you can expect in the future if youâre thinking about selling:1. More expensive mortgages. A higher interest rate means a more expensive loan payment, but the rate at which theyâre rising is astounding. Rates are up 2% since the start of the year, which means the average homebuyerâs affordability has dropped by 20%. This has already priced some buyers out of the market, and if rates continue to rise as expected, it will price out even more of them. This is going to make the pool of potential buyers for your home much shallower, resulting in fewer offers.âContinued low supply will keep property values up.â2. Increased rental rates. One often-overlooked factor in all of this is rental rates. As homeownership becomes more expensive and more out of reach for some buyers, rental demand is only going to increase, which means that rent prices will jump up as well.3. Supply is still short. Although homes are more expensive, the demand for them is still high. The increased interest rates have also caused home sellers to stay in their homes longer, and our typical spring and summer surge of inventory just isnât happening right now. Low supply is good news for homeowners because it will keep your property values up.4. Weâre not headed for a crash. Some buyers and sellers are rushing to the market in fear of an impending crash. However, there arenât many parallels between this market and that of 2008 when the last crash occurred. That crisis was the result of irresponsible lending practices. Since then, underwriting standards have tightened significantly.The current frenzied market has been brought on by basic supply and demand, and any kind of market crash is pretty unlikely. According to Brandon Haefele, CEO of Catalyst Mortgage, âI think weâre now going to start seeing individual markets potentially have some slowdownâ¦my reasoning is we still have extremely low inventory. But itâs not going to go the other way and crash.âAlthough rising rates are going to cause some buyers to leave the market entirely, all of the evidence weâve seen on the ground points to home values continuing to appreciate as long as supply remains this low.

If youâre thinking about buying or selling a home this year, there are certain things you must know, and I want to talk about them with you today.If youâre a seller, itâs all about having a plan. Itâs still challenging to buy with a home sale contingency, so youâd likely need to buy your next house before selling the current one.Â Consider utilizing our certified home program, which includes a pre-inspection. That will alert you to any potential problems with the home before you list and motivate buyers to get top dollar.âDonât lose hope as a homebuyer.âAs for buyers, a full pre-approval letter from a local lender is a great place to start. Donât think you can get away with a letter from an online lender. Also, make sure youâre focused on the monthly payment you desire, not the homeâs sticker price.Another tip for buyers is to bring your A-game. You need to make the best offer possible, and youâll likely have to offer above the list price while waiving contingencies. This will be uncomfortable, but itâs what you have to do to win these days.Youâre going to lose out to other buyers, but donât lose hope. When you finally win a great home, youâll be so happy that you stayed the course.If you have any questions for me about buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, donât hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

        "content": "Five tips to help you make your long-distance move as easy as possible.Are you or someone you know thinking about making a move out of the area, perhaps across the country or somewhere across the globe? With remote work being so common these days, moving to your dream location isnât as difficult as it once was. However, that doesnât mean a long-distance move will be easy. The logistics, the travel, and the timeline can all be tricky to manage, and preparing for these potential challenges is key. Here are a few tips to keep in mind if youâre looking to make a move outside of Madison this year:1. Map out a detailed timetable. Set milestones for each important step, such as booking your movers, scheduling cleaning services, and having everything packed up. This way, you can make the move as smooth as possible.2. Calculate a realistic budget. Make a spreadsheet of all the expenses you can expect. Remember to include things like closing costs, packing supplies, movers, storage truck rentals, travel, etc.âWith remote work being so common these days, moving to your dream location isnât as difficult as it once was.â3. Declutter and do a home inventory. Begin by decluttering your house and donating anything that you no longer need. Then, do an inventory of the items you are bringing with you. When you pack, label every box clearly so that you know exactly where to put it upon arrival in your new home.4. Account for the comfort and safety of kids and pets. Youâll need to make arrangements for babysitters, road entertainment, or pet accommodations.5. Let us connect you to the market that youâre moving into. When you need to find a great agent in your new area, let me and my team help you make that connection. With our Keller Williams partnership, weâre part of the largest real estate network in the world. We can do the heavy lifting of screening agents for you so that you get to work with one who shares the same values and commitments that we do.We hope you found these tips informative.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Hereâs how using a VA loan to build a home differs from the usual process.Today Iâm joined by Jordann Hartzheim from Guaranteed Rate Mortgage, who is here to talk about VA home construction loans. Jordann is an expert at helping people get to the closing table on the financial side of things, so her advice is invaluable. With the VA loan, we know that buying a home as a Veteran isnât terribly difficult. However, when a Veteran wants to build a home, the process becomes quite different.First,Â find a builder who will finance the land and the construction of the home itself. The builders will find out what the actual value of the home is, and when you come to an agreement about the value, youâll be able to get financing from the builder. Once the construction is complete, an appraiser will do a final inspection to make sure that everything is up to par with what was agreed upon. From there, the process is the same as a regular VA closing.âAs long as youâre working with a VA-approved builder, youâll still enjoy all the same great benefits that the VA loan has to offer.âThe main difference between this process and the traditional VA buying process is that the builder is more involved in the upfront financing. But how do buyers know if a builder can do this? As an expert, Jordann can recommend well-known builders in the area who have been approved by the VA and are able to provide upfront financing. As long as youâre working with a VA-approved builder, youâll still enjoy all the same great benefits that the VA loan has to offer, like zero money down and no private mortgage insurance.Itâs exciting to know that Guaranteed Rate Mortgage can to help our Veterans build new homes. If youâd like to learn more about this program, visit www.Rate.com/jordannhartzheim or call (715) 892-7799.And if you have any questions about buying new construction or real estate in general, donât hesitate to call or email us at The Holt Real Estate Team.

        "content": "My three big predictions for the real estate market this year.Are you thinking about making a move this year? To help you form a solid plan and know what you can expect, here are my predictions for the 2022 market:1. Mortgage rates will rise above 3.5%. Rates remain around 3% right now. However, with a strong employment market, inflation, and the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, I expect rates to rise to 4% before the yearâs end. For the average mortgage in the Madison area, that would add $117 to your monthly payment.2. Price growth will come down. With increasing rates, the more expensive market will cause home buyers to delay their purchases. With that many people leaving the market, we expect home price growth to return to the single digits. This does not mean overall prices will drop, just the rate of year-over-year growth.âWe may be headed toward a more balanced market. â3. New listing inventory will hit a 10-year high. As the market continues to normalize, many homeowners will be encouraged to list their homes. As the year progresses, home sale contingencies may become more common, and homeowners will finally decide to cash out as price appreciation slows down.It appears that we may be headed toward a more balanced market. However, that wonât happen overnight. If you have any questions on the local real estate market or just need some advice on how to move forward, give me a call or send me an email.

This seems pretty crazy, but when you look at the graph at 0:44 in the video, you can see that weâve only been playing catch up. Prices crashed during the 2008 crisis, and theyâre only now starting to return to normal.Â âThe factors that led to our crazy market will still be present in 2022.âIt seems like our accelerating home values peaked towards the end of 2021, but that does not mean they will decrease soon.

That way, kids and their parents can reach your door safely.2. Keep your pets out of sight. Pets can often get stressed out by seeing so many strangers come to the door. Put them in another room to reduce their stress and prevent them from scaring anyone.3. Park your cars in the garage, if possible. That ensures your trick-or-treaters will have enough room to get to your front door.4. Use flameless LED candles in your jack-oâ-lanterns instead of real candles. This eliminates the fire hazard that burning candles presents.âHave a safe, fun, and happy Halloween!âOn the other hand, if youâre planning to go out into the neighborhood and trick or treat, here are a few points to follow:1. Stick to neighborhoods with sidewalks. It usually gets dark around that time, so finding areas with sidewalks means that you wonât have to walk in the streets. It might be a good idea to put reflective tape on your kidsâ jackets or costumes to make sure that cars can see them.2. Keep to the crosswalks. Donât just dart across the road to get to the next home; if you or your children are wearing dark costumes, it might be hard for oncoming cars to see them.3. Carry a flashlight with you. Some driveways might be long and dark, so having a flashlight can come in handy.4. Remind your kids not to enter a strangerâs home. Have them stay on the front porch and in full view.5. Be mindful of the treats your kids receive. You never knowâsomeone might put a food item in their bag that your kids are allergic to, or they might slip in something that isnât necessarily appropriate. Comb through the candy before letting them eat it.We hope you and yours have a safe, fun, and happy Halloween!As always, if you feel like your home search is like hunting for a unicorn, give our team a call.

While inventory levels continue to sit near historic lows, there are indications that we may have hit the lowest point weâll see and that weâre possibly working our way back up.In May, inventory was at 2.5 months of supply, which was up from 2.4 in April. Thatâs a trend weâre seeing on both the national and local levels; the monthsâ supply has increased every month since the beginning of the year. Though weâre still nowhere near a balanced market (around six months of supply), we are seeing a slow but steady increase in homes for sale.âMore homes for sale mean that buyers have more options and sellers have more competition.âThat has left many buyers and sellers wondering about how this will affect their prospects. If youâre a buyer, this means that more options are arriving, so now may be the best time to act. As the number of homes for sale goes up, the less competition there will be and the less intense the bidding wars will become. If youâve been struggling to find a home, this news should bring you some hope and motivation to keep looking. Experts have been projecting that mortgage rates may begin to increase toward the end of the year, which will only make purchasing a home a bit less affordable as time passes.If youâre a seller in todayâs market, now is still a good time to sell. If youâve been putting it off, donât wait much longer. This yearâs month-over-month gains in the number of homes for sale have helped buyers, but weâre still very much in a sellerâs market. More homes are expected to hit the market in the coming months, so selling this summer gives you a chance to get ahead of the competition and maximize your sales potential.The bottom line is that more homes for sale mean that buyers have more options and sellers have more competition.If youâre looking to buy or sell or if you have any questions about the local market, reach out to us.

        "content": "Make sure your home stays safe and sound during your vacation.How can you make sure your home is ready for your upcoming vacation? Here are 10 tips to ensure you donât come back to any unwanted surprises:1. Lock all of your doors and windows. This may seem like the most obvious tip, but it can still be forgottenâespecially locking the windows.2. Clear out your mailbox and put your mail on hold. This includes any magazines, newspapers, or other subscriptions you have. Subscription boxes (e.g., meal deliveries) tend to be forgotten about the most, so make sure you put those on hold as well. You donât want these boxes sitting on your front step letting people know youâre gone and/or spoiling because youâre not there to take them in.3. Use lights to create the illusion that someone is home. With the advent of smart lighting, you can control some of your house lights with your phone. You can also use old-school timersâanything to make sure lights are coming on and off and creating the illusion that someone is home.âWait until after you get back home to upload any pictures or videos to your social media profiles.â4. Keep your yard maintained. If a landscaping company takes care of your yard, make sure you keep that service scheduled while youâre away. Before you leave, you could also do some extra clipping around the yard so things donât look overgrown while youâre gone.5. Leave a car in the driveway. This creates the impression that someone is home and lessens the chance that your home becomes a target for burglars.6. Hide and lock up your valuables. Nothing should be in plain sight. If you have someone checking on your home while youâre away, have them double-check that your valuables are secure and stored away.7. Donât broadcast your plans online. Going on vacation is a lot of fun, and itâs only natural to want to share your experiences with people you know, but wait until after you get back home to upload any pictures or videos to your social media profiles. Also, think twice before checking into places online. You never know whoâs checking that type of thingâespecially if your profile is set to a public setting.8. Activate your security system (if you have one). If you donât, perhaps try setting up some cameras. Even as decoys, they can act as deterrents. You donât need to place your cameras inconspicuously, either. Put them out there so people can see that theyâre there. Again, burglars are less likely to target your property if they think a close eye is being kept on it.9. Adjust your thermostat. If you have a smart thermostat, that can be set from your phone.10. Do what you can to prevent water damage. If youâre traveling during the summer, it might be OK for you to turn off your water main. If youâre traveling during the winter, you probably donât want to do this.As always, if you have questions about this topic or would like to know more about our local real estate market, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Rent-backs benefit both buyers and sellers in this market.How do seller rent-backs benefit buyers and sellers in this market?Seller rent-backs (formally known as âpost-close occupanciesâ) have been around for a while; theyâre an arrangement when the seller continues living in the home thatâs been sold and which the buyer now owns. They can last anywhere from one to 60 days if the buyer is purchasing the home as their primary residence. That said, this time frame can be limited by the buyerâs financing. If the buyer is purchasing the home as an investment property, the rent-back can last as long as needed.Â Rent-backs benefit sellers in that they give them more time to get their future housing plans in order. Weâre seeing a lot more of this type of situation lately. For example, if a homeowner needs to sell their current home and purchase a new one, they may need the proceeds of the first sale to complete the second one. In our market, 60 days isnât a very long time, but it can make a difference. If the sellerâs closing date is close by and they just need a few extra days to get their affairs in order, the rent-back would only last a few days.âIn our current market, itâs not uncommon for buyers to offer free rent-backs to sellers.âRent-backs benefit buyers when they have a lease that doesnât end for a while or they have some flexibility in their timeline. This way, they can have the seller stay longer and pay rent. However, in our current market, itâs not uncommon for buyers to offer free rent-backs to sellers. Theyâre looking for any opportunity to make their offers stand out from the crowd. In less competitive markets of the past, a typical rent-back amount would be prorated per day according to the buyerâs daily carrying costs.Â What are the risks of a rent-back? The risk for a buyer is that their seller may not move out in time. This can obviously be a challenge if theyâve selected a certain day to move in. Other than that, though, the risks for both sides are minimal. My team and I have a specific addendum we use to document the terms of a rent-back period. Typically, a security deposit is held in escrow while the rent-back takes place. Itâs also important that both parties document the condition of the property so that if there are any questions, they have something to refer back to.Â As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "title": "5 Reasons Weâre Not in a Housing Bubble",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Fear not, buyer and sellersâhere are five reasons weâre not in a housing bubble:1. Mortgage lending standards are stricter than they were prior to the last housing crash. It was much easier to get a mortgage back then. Today itâs simply much tougher to qualify. If you look at the graph at 0:43 in the video, youâll understand why. The easiest way to understand that graph is this: The higher the number, the easier it is to get a mortgage.Â 2. Prices are not soaring out of control. Though price appreciation has been quite strong recently, itâs nowhere near the kind of rise we saw before the crash. The average annual appreciation is around 3.6%, and although our average is higher than this historic norm, itâs not accelerating beyond control as it did in the early 2000s.Â 3. Thereâs not a surplus of homes on the market. On the contrary, we have a home shortage. A balanced market has around six months of supply. Anything more is an overabundance, which causes prices to depreciate. Anything less is a shortage, which will lead to continued appreciation. As you can see at 1:39, there were simply too many homes on the market in 2007 compared to right now. Further fueling this shortage is the drastic decrease in new construction homes. Over the previous decade, we saw significantly fewer homes built compared to the previous decades that led up to the housing crash.Â âUnless we find a way to solve the housing shortage issue, we wonât see a bubble burst anytime soon.â4. Homes became too expensive to buy in 2007âtheyâre more affordable now. The affordability formula factors into a homeâs price, the wages earned by the purchaser, and the mortgage rate. If you flash back to 14 years ago, prices were high, wages were low, and mortgage rates were more than 6% on average. While prices are still high today, wages have increased and mortgage rates are closer to 3%. Compared to 2006, a lower percentage of median income is needed to purchase a median-priced home.Â 5. People are equity rich now instead of tapped out. Prior to the bubble, homeowners were treating their homes like an ATM. Many were withdrawing their equity as soon as it built up and using it for things that werenât necessarily housing-related. They learned their lesson in the process. Todayâs homeowners arenât tapping into their equity in that fashion. Over 50% of the homes in the country have over 50% equity.Â As you can see, weâre not in a housing bubble. Itâs a simple matter of supply and demand. We donât have enough homes on the market to meet the demand. Thatâs why prices continue to increase, and itâs why peopleâs equity positions continue to increase as well. Unless we find a way to solve the housing shortage issue, we wonât see a bubble burst anytime soon.Â If you have questions about this topic or thereâs anything else I can assist you with, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "title": "5 Tips for Buying in a Sellerâs Market",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Itâs an incredibly strong sellerâs market right now, and competition among buyers is fierce. If youâre thinking about starting the home search, there are a few things youâll want to keep in mind. Here are five tips for buying a home while in a sellerâs market:1. Qualify for the lowest mortgage rate you can. Home prices have been high, and they still may rise by another 5.7% by the end of the year. Thankfully, record-low interest rates can help offset some of the cost. There are also ways you can make the rate even better: Before you go to the lender, work on boosting your credit score, paying down debt, settling overdue accounts, and alerting credit bureaus of any errors. Putting forth a higher down payment can also help your rate.2. Get pre-approved before starting your search. It may seem a good idea to search online and try to schedule an appointment when you find your dream house. Unfortunately, most sellers wonât even let you in the door unless you can prove you have the financial ability to purchase their home. So, meet with a lender and get your pre-approval established before you try to go to showings.âThough we may be a sellerâs market, that doesnât mean finding and winning a home is impossible.â3. Work with an experienced agent. There are a lot of agents out there, but many only commit to real estate as a hobby or part-time gig. Not all of them will have the skills needed to help you navigate the market successfully. Find a Realtor who has the experience, tools, and information that buyers and sellers need in order to win. For example, The Holt Real Estate team can tour properties on your behalf, find little-known homes that are hitting the market soon, and represent you through every part of the process.4. Consider buying when the market isnât so hot. Most experts predict the market will cool off a bit later in the year. As more people get vaccinated, itâs likely that many sellers will feel comfortable enough to finally put their homes on the market. In fact, an economist from Realtor.com says that the 2021 market will be more hospitable toward buyers as new construction ramps up and more listings arrive. If you can wait a few more months to buy, it may be a good idea.5. Make your offer stand out. In this market, youâll want to pull out all the stops to make an attractive offer. However, a good offer isnât all about price. You should also be flexible with your closing day, and you can perhaps give the seller extra time to move out after the deal is complete. You can remove contingencies and add more to your earnest money deposit.Though we may be a sellerâs market, that doesnât mean finding and winning a home is impossible.

        "title": "4 Misconceptions About Sellerâs Markets",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâve been following real estate market news, you likely know weâre in a red-hot sellerâs market, homes are selling for way over asking price, sellers are receiving great terms and conditions, and things are currently a little crazy. Due to everything thatâs going on, Iâm sharing four common misconceptions about a strong sellerâs market:1. You must plan for your next home before listing your current one. I believe this misconception is whatâs keeping most people from putting their houses on the market right now. Many people think they canât list their property for sale until they already have their next home lined up. In reality, in the present market, sellers control more terms and conditions than usual. Asking for an extended closing date or negotiating a post-closing occupancy of up to 60 days gives sellers time to find their next house after theyâve secured an offer on their current one.2. The homeâs condition doesnât matter. Plenty of people think they can just list their property in any condition and itâll sell quickly. Sometimes an as-is sale makes sense and is the best approach, but that isnât normally the case. In truth, the condition still sells the home.Â Houses in the best condition will sell quicker and for the most money. When you hear that people are getting wildly high offers and excellent terms, itâs because their properties are in their best conditions. You may need to paint, clean, declutter, and do all the other things to prepare the home that you would do in any market.âIn the present market, sellers control more terms and conditions than usual.â3. You can price your home above market value. In our market, itâs crucial to set an appropriate asking price. Buyers are already concerned about overpaying and fatigued by what theyâve been experiencing out in the market. If you list your house higher than it should be, tons of buyers will simply avoid it. Ultimately, youâll be playing catch-up and will probably sell for less than you would have if youâd priced it correctly from the beginning.Â 4. You donât need a Realtor. Since everythingâs selling so quickly, thereâs a temptation to sell your property on your own and save a little money. However, homes are receiving multiple offers and a slew of showings, and you need an expert in your corner who knows how to help you manage the process. Real estate agents qualify buyers before they walk through the house so that only those capable of making an offer are allowed to view it.Â When the offers start pouring in, you need someone who can help negotiate the best terms for your situation. Itâs not always about the highest price; numerous other things go into an offer. You may also be tempted to use a discount broker who will just list the property on the MLS and leave the rest of the work to you. However, if you want to maximize your position in todayâs market, you need an expert agent that will provide the world-class marketing your home deserves.If you have any questions about this market or how to sell your house, you can always give us a call or send an email. Weâd love to talk to you about what your home is worth and how weâd maximize your position in the market.",

Walk around the perimeter of your home and tackle any areas that need to be cleaned, trimmed, or repainted. Oftentimes, youâll find debris and buildup leftover from winter. Also, take a look at your front doorâhas it seen better days? A fresh coat of paint could bring it back to life.Â When was the last time you truly looked at the address numbers on your house? Straighten them if theyâre misaligned and make sure theyâre not faded.

        "content": "What happens when an appraisal comes in short? This is certainly an appropriate concern in our current real estate market, as prices look like theyâre on a never-ending upward trajectory. As a seller, you have three options when an appraiser doesnât value your home for the price you agreed to sell it for.First, check the appraisal for human error. Mistakes can happen, so perhaps something got miscalculated. Take a thorough look through your homeâs appraisal and see whether there are any issues that couldâve caused it to come in low.If everything checks out, your next option is to prepare a rebuttal with the help of your agent. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesnât. In any case, your agent can evaluate the comparable properties the appraiser used and see whether they were justified. If possible, they can also prepare their own list of comparable properties that can bring the appraisal up to where you need it to be.âIt can be challenging to get any adjustments made in an appraisal.âOf course, depending on where things are in the contract-to-close period, donât assume that the buyer actually wants the appraisal to come in low, because that could adversely impact them as well.

Oftentimes, appraisers will choose to stick to their guns, but a rebuttal is still a shot worth taking.If a rebuttal doesnât work, youâll have to return to the negotiating table and see if you and the buyer can still make the transaction work.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Recently, I met with a client of mine who had been debating whether to wait a few months into the spring market to list their home or do it now. I shared with them these four reasons why now might be the absolute best time to act:Â 1. Motivated buyers. When your homeâs listed on the mid- to late-winter market, youâll be encountering far more serious buyers than those youâd be attracting in spring. Theyâve already taken the steps to ensure theyâre pre-approved, they know exactly what they want, and they most likely have life circumstances that necessitate purchasing a home as soon as possible (e.g., job relocation).Â 2. Less competition. Many people still buy into the conventional wisdom that says itâs best to take a home off the market around the holidays and/or during the Wisconsin winter months. This predictable behavior results in even less inventory in a market thatâs already dealing with an inventory shortage. Contrary to popular belief, people do still have to buy when the temperatures bottom out and snow covers the ground. Just by being on the market now, youâll capture a larger share of this motivated buyer pool.Â âYou can enjoy everything the spring market has to offer right now but with even more advantages.â3. The spring market has already started. Truth be told, real estate is no longer as dominated by seasonality as it once was. Weâre encountering extremely high demand on every one of our current listings, which proves that sellers can now find themselves firmly in the driverâs seat even in wintertime. By listing now, youâll be able to find buyers who are more willing to accommodate your needs. Forget about having to negotiate for favorable termsâthe buyers will be leading with highly attractive terms. Given our market conditions, buyers are willing to do what it takes to get into a home they love.Â 4. You can show off your homeâs unique features. Perhaps you have a charming fireplace to light up when these shorter days give way to darkness. Maybe you have a cozy living room that lends itself well to buyersâ visions of staying nice and warm with loved ones as they watch the first snowfall. Alternatively, it could be the case that your landscaping isnât quite where it needs to be; a little snow cover will conveniently blanket any eyesores.Â Bonus reason: low inventory. Yes, I already touched on this, but I canât stress it enough: Weâre dealing with the lowest inventory that we have ever seen. So, as long as they are no other major life factors preventing you from putting your home on the market today, then youâll benefit greatly from getting ahead of the so-called âbest selling seasonâ of spring. You can enjoy everything the spring market has to offer right now but with even more advantages.If youâd like help getting the selling process started, please reach out via phone or email anytime.

In the simplest terms, a homeâs appraisal calculates its value, while an inspection determines its condition.Â Whatâs the purpose of an appraisal? When you apply for a mortgage (or, occasionally, when youâre using cash to purchase), an unbiased appraisal is the best way to confirm the value of the home based on the sale price, regardless of what youâre willing to pay for it. This is especially critical in todayâs sellerâs market where low inventory is increasing bidding wars and pushing prices upward. However, your lender will only allow you to borrow based on the true value of the home.Â âIn the simplest terms, a homeâs appraisal calculates its value, while an inspection determines its condition.âA home inspection, meanwhile, determines the current state, safety, and condition of the home before you finalize the sale.

Here are five steps to follow that will make things easier and less stressful:1. Start packing now. Itâs best to start packing up any items you donât need daily and get them out of the way so theyâre not taking up space.Â 2. Sell, donate, or give it away. Moving is a great opportunity to purge yourself of things youâve collected over the years that you donât use anymore or wonât miss if theyâre gone. I recommend selling, donating, or giving these things away.Â 3. Get squeaky clean. Now is the time to ensure your home shines, so deep clean as much as possible. Itâs been proven that homes that show well due to being clean and well-kept generate higher offers than those that are dirty and unkept. If you list your home with The Holt Real Estate Team, weâll enlist the service of professional cleaners to clean your home before taking its listing photos so it looks its absolute best.Â âItâs been proven that homes that are clean and well-kept generate higher offers.â4. Maintain your privacy and security. Make sure you donât leave out any personal documents or valuable items during showings and open houses. Pack these things up and store them in a secure location.Â 5. Involve your kids. You wouldnât believe how motivated kids can get when you attach something fun to a chore. You can make a game out of packing away their toys, for example.Â In addition to professional cleaning services, if you list with our team, youâll get professional staging, photography, video, and a comprehensive marketing plan. This guarantees that weâll sell your home for the best price in the exact timeline you need.Â If you have questions about this or any real estate topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Despite everything, the housing market was one sector of the economy that performed consistently well throughout 2020. What do experts think this coming year will bring? Here are four trends to watch out for:Â 1. Prices will continue to rise. If inventory remains as low as it has, itâs possible that prices will continue to go up. The median sold price for properties in our area was $315,000 this yearâa 6.8% increase compared to 2019. Inventory also further declined by 26.3% year over year. Despite a quick burst of new listings toward the end of the summer (perhaps due to a delay in the market caused by the pandemic), a dwindling supply of houses is great news for sellers but not so much for buyers.Â 2. Suburbs will reign supreme. We talked about this trend early this year, and it looks like it will continue. As more and more folks find out that itâs easier for them to work remotely or that proximity to where they work isnât as important, theyâll look to buy homes farther and farther away from city centers. Many people are starting to look toward neighboring counties or smaller communities where they can get a bigger bang for their buck.Â âHistorically low rates have brought buyers out en masse, which has caused low inventory, rising prices, and a flurry of activity.â3. Increased builder confidence. Builders are becoming more confident in their futures, and weâre now seeing more and more new construction starts happening than weâve seen in the past few years. Also, buyers who arenât finding what theyâre looking for in the resale market are turning to the new construction market as an alternative to find a home that fits their needs.Â 4. Mortgage rates will remain low. Mortgage rates hit several record lows throughout 2020, and this trend seems likely to continueâat least during the early part of 2021. Historically low rates have brought buyers out en masse, which has caused low inventory, rising prices, and a flurry of activity. Weâre no longer seeing a seasonality in our market. Instead, buyers are buying when they need to buy and sellers are selling when they need to sell. Buyers, especially, are trying hard to capitalize on these low mortgage rates.Â As always, if you have questions about our local real estate market or thereâs a topic youâd like to see me cover in a future video, call or email me anytime.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are plenty of delightful myths and legends surrounding the holiday seasonâmistletoes, toy-making elves, and a jolly, red-suited gift-bearer to name a few. Such tales add cheer and nostalgia to the season, but some myths can spoil the season. Here are the five most common home-selling myths that sellers should leave out in the snow this year:Â Myth No. 1: Buyers are waiting to enter the marketThe truth is, interest rates remain near record lows, so buyers are out there searching in earnest for the right home that they can purchase at the right rate. With so many unknowns (e.g., a new administration in the White House and several viable COVID-19 vaccines on the horizon), buyers arenât betting that these insanely low rates will hang around much longer.Â Myth No. 2: Fall and winter are just bad times to sellÂ There really isnât as much seasonality to the real estate market as there used to be; people will make a move when itâs the right time for them to do so. Thatâs why I always tell people that the only âright timeâ to buy a home is when it makes the most sense for their specific circumstances.Â âAmerican homeowners on the whole have greater equity positions, which means they can walk away from their property if things get dicey.âMyth No. 3: Home prices are decreasingÂ Unfortunately, if youâre a buyer, that isnât the case at all. Sellers, on the other hand, have a lot to smile about: Weâre continuing to see year-over-year increases in sales prices. In fact, weâre up 5.5% from where we were at this time last year.Â Myth No. 4: You wonât be able to show your homeWe take great pride in prioritizing everyoneâs health and safety by implementing special systems and processes. We have ways to show your home to potential buyers virtually (an increasingly popular option), and in the event that people do come through your home, weâre taking extra steps to ensure that a) those buyers are completely qualified, and b) everyone is following CDC guidelines. That means weâre vetting people for symptoms, requiring them to wear masks and gloves inside the home, minimizing the amount of contact theyâll have with surfaces, and using sanitizer.Â Myth No. 5: The real estate market is going to crashWhatâs happening now in the real estate market is completely different from the situation that led to the 2008 collapse and subsequent Great Recession. Mortgage lending is much, much more responsible, and American homeowners, on the whole, have greater equity positions, which gives them plenty of options to recoup some of their equity should they find themselves in mortgage trouble. The U.S. economy is certainly stronger in some sectors than in others, and real estate has proven itself to be one of the titanic forces holding things up as COVID-19 wreaks havoc. According to basic supply and demand relationships, we wonât see a market crash anytime soon.Â I hope you found value in todayâs blog.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Even if youâre not planning on selling your home anytime soon, here are four ways you can save money as a homeowner right now:1. Reach out to your insurance agent. Most homeowners simply renew their initial homeowners insurance policy every time it comes up for renewal without examining it to see how they can save money. They also sometimes forget to ensure that they have an adequate amount of coverage for their home. I suggest reaching out to your agent to see how you can save money with your current policy. You can also reach out to me and Iâd be happy to discuss how our service, Keller Covered, can save you money on your homeowners insurance premiums.Â 2. Install a smart thermostat. These products have been around for a while now, and theyâve only gotten better at programming the preferred climate in your home. Theyâve also been proven to help you save money on your monthly utility bills, so this is definitely something you should look into as we get closer to winter.Â âIf you need recommendations for service providers who can help with these tips, donât hesitate to reach out to me.â3. Get a home warranty. I know what you may be thinking: âJosh, isnât that an expense?â While there is a cost to having a home warranty (usually a few hundred dollars), it covers many big-ticket repair items. If something breaks in your air conditioning, plumbing, or electrical system, having that repair cost covered will save you a substantial amount of money.4. Get a home inspection. Getting a home inspection is something people usually do when they buy a home, but getting a home inspection after you own the home is beneficial, too. The inspector can evaluate areas of your home you might be unaware of and spot some much-needed repairs. This way, you can fix them before they become a much bigger issue down the road.Â Of course, if you need recommendations for service providers who can help with these tips, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd be happy to show you our list of service providers and help you save money.Â Lastly, I want to remind you that the Holt Real Estate Team is still offering our real estate checkups. Your home is your biggest asset, so donât neglect its health. Just give us a call, and weâll evaluate your home and expenses; weâll tell you how to maximize your homeownership goals.

        "content": "To help you understand todayâs market update, Iâd like to share some insights from the National Association of Realtorsâ chief economist Lawrence Yun. He was recently asked for his prognosis for the upcoming housing market based on how things have progressed so far in 2020. In response, he said:  âCooler weather wonât chill the housing marketâs rally, as strong existing home sales and record-high pending home sales in August indicate no homebuying slowdown [this] fall. Further, the striking market turnaround since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic has brought a resurgence in bidding wars and has proved housingâs resilience in an unusual and volatile year. [â¦] But a mix of surging buyer demand and low inventory puts the industry in uncharted territory.â  âThe median home price has soared to an all-time height of $300,000, threatening to choke off first-time buyers from the market and depress the national homeownership rate. More homebuilding is necessary to relieve some of the market pressures. New home sales hit more than 1,000,000 year to date in Septemberâan encouraging sign. However, lumber shortages are pushing up new home prices by an average of $14,000 since April.ââWe have now experienced a year-over-year increase in median sold prices every month since March of 2016.âSo what does that mean for us locally?Despite the pandemic, home sales in our region have kept pace with 2019. The continued lack of inventory puts upward pressure on home prices. Year to date, our median home price is up by 5.5% over last year. We have now experienced a year-over-year increase in median sold prices every month since March of 2016.So what can we expect from the future?Interest rates are likely to remain low, which will keep demand high. Despite the variables that the pandemic has thrown into the mix, housing stats remain aligned to the seasonal trends of previous years, which gives us insight into what we can possibly expect in the coming winter months.If you have any questions about the market or how the conditions affect your buying and selling prospects, please reach out to us.

        "content": "If youâre thinking about putting your home on the market at any point in the near future, Iâve got some great tips to share with you today. There are upgrades and renovations you can make to increase your homeâs sale price and get a great return on your investment, but there are also common upgrades and renovations that wonât do either of those things.I donât typically recommend big, expensive upgrades right before selling. If you plan on living in the home for a while longer and enjoying them, though, it makes more sense. Here are the things that will bring you a good return as a seller:1. Kitchen. This typically sells the home for most buyers. You donât necessarily need to renovate the entire room, but any updates you do make will give you a great bang for your buck.2. Energy-saving features. A lot of buyers are looking for energy efficiency, so if you have older appliances that arenât as efficient, you may want to replace them. You could also update windows to become more energy efficient as well. Anything you can do to lower the energy cost for a future buyer is a good call.Â 3. Curb appeal. If you have old, cracked paint chips on your siding, itâs a good idea to put a fresh coat on or replace that siding. New siding and new paint give sellers one of the best returns on their investment.4. Front door. Itâs what sticks out first to a buyer when they show up to your home. You donât have to replace the door, either. A fresh coat of paint could do wonders.âYour money can be spent more wisely than on a new deck.âThose are the main updates I recommend, but here are a few that I donât:1. Bathroom. A full bathroom remodel or the addition of a new bathroom typically isnât worth what it costs. The average return is only about 56%.2. Deck. Having a deck is nice, but building one before you sell isnât a good idea. Buyers arenât really looking for decks in particular. Your money could be better spent somewhere else.3. Master suite. Everyone thinks people want that magazine-worthy, luxurious master suite. When it comes down to it, though, people would rather pay for the home without one than with one. On average, a master suite addition can cost over $100,000 and only results in about a 64% ROI.If you have any questions for me about what you should do to your home before selling, donât hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

        "title": "Q: Having a Tough Time Navigating Our Sellerâs Market?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "After helping out a first-time homebuyer recently, I realized the advice I gave could be incredibly helpful for others to have. So today, Iâd like to share the five tips you should know when navigating a sellerâs market like the one weâre currently experiencing:1. Be decisive. If youâre going to come out on top, youâll need to be ready to make decisions. Time is critical in a sellerâs market, and often, getting your dream home simply means being the first person in line. If you see the perfect home come on the market, donât wait until the weekend for a showing. Set something up as soon as possibleâif you canât, Iâd be happy to help set up a virtual showing for you. Speaking of which, you want an accessible, speedy real estate agent like me on your side. A responsive agent is a must-have in these markets where buyers need to act quickly.2. Submit a clean offer. This may not be the best time to submit an offer with a long list of contingencies. Contingencies could mean the difference between getting the home of your dreams and missing out on it. A seller may be more interested in wrapping things up quickly instead of fetching a higher price but losing out on time. Think about dropping or at least modifying traditional contingencies; your offer may look more appealing because it means thereâs a lower chance of you backing out of the deal.Â However, there are still ways to protect yourself. You can get your loan completely underwritten by your lender, for example.âIf youâre going to come out on top, youâll need to be ready to make decisions.â3. Let go of perfection. Inventory is limited right now, but demand is incredibly high. This situation means itâs less likely that youâll find the perfect home, but thatâs perfectly fine. Often, itâs better to settle with a good home and make it perfect instead of waiting forever for a property that may never come. Even when inventory expands, itâs rare for the âperfectâ home to appear.4. Be disciplined with your budget. Things can get competitive among buyers, and itâs easy to get carried away and offer more than youâre comfortable with. You may get so attached to a house that you go well above your budget, so set a maximum price point and stick with it. Sure, you may not get the house you were interested in, but youâre also skipping out on the years of financial stress that comes from overextending your budget.5. Offer more earnest money. Earnest money is similar to a deposit and is provided alongside your offer. It shows youâre serious, but youâre able to get the money back if the deal doesnât go through. Buyers in our market usually offer 1% of the purchase price, but itâs a good idea to offer more in a hot market. It shows youâre more interested and are less likely to back out of the transaction.If youâre thinking about jumping into the market and buying a home, letâs set up a free consultation and go over what youâre looking for, what you can afford, and what your current home (if you have one) is worth. Whether itâs in person or via phone call, Zoom meeting, or some other virtual means, Iâd be happy to walk you through your specific home buying situation. To set up a consultation, just give me a call at (608) 345-6594 or email JDHolt@KW.com. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "When most folks search for a new home, they naturally start by looking at prices. Itâs important to consider what else impacts the purchase before making a decision, though. Itâs not just the price that matters, but the overall cost of owning the home.Today this cost is largely impacted by low mortgage rates. Low rates are making homes more affordable now than at any time since 2016. These rates are offsetting rising home prices because itâs less expensive to borrow money. In essence, purchasing a home while rates are this low may save you significantly over the life of your mortgage loan.Â What are the experts saying about home affordability? NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun says, âAlthough housing prices have consistently moved higher, when the favorable mortgage rates are factored in, an overall home purchase was more affordable in 2020âs second quarter compared to one year ago.âÂ âPurchasing a home while rates are this low may save you significantly over the life of your mortgage loan.âAccording to Mortgage News Daily, âThose shopping for a home can afford 10% more home than they could have one year ago while keeping their monthly payment unchanged. This translates into nearly $32,000 more buying power when looking at a median-priced home.âSo again, when purchasing a home, think about the overall cost of ownershipânot just the price.

        "content": "Aside from your agentâs commission, there are four closing costs to prepare for when selling your home:Â 1. Ownerâs title policy. This is included in most real estate transactions so the property will transfer freely and clearly to the buyerâs name. Lenders will require this, and any buyer will want to know that their new home is theirs without issue. Typically, this fee is based on the homeâs sale price. For example, the fee for a $300,000 home will typically be $1,000 to $1,200, depending on which title company you work with. If youâre able to provide the policy from when you purchased the home, you may get a discount.Â 2. State transfer tax. This tax is required by the state of Wisconsin and amounts to roughly $3 per $1,000 of the sale price. Again, if we use the example of a $300,000 home, the transfer tax would be $900.Â âIâd be happy to prepare you a complimentary, no-obligation home value analysis.â3. Additional title fees. These include the deep preparation, special assessment search, gap endorsement, and mortgage payoff fees. Each of these tends to be fixed costs (i.e., not tied to the sale price) and range from a little less than $100 to slightly more depending on the item.Â 4. Property tax proration.Â If you close on your home sale at the end of the year as opposed to the beginning, this will be a larger amount. For example, if you sell at the end of August and your property tax is around $6,000, youâd pay $4,000.Â There may be other fees to account for based on your situation, so if youâd like to know more about this topic, give me a call and Iâd be happy to prepare you a complimentary, no-obligation home value analysis and seller net sheet.Â As always, if you have any other real estate questions, donât hesitate to reach out to me as well.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Iâve recently had some clients ask me questions about radon. They want to know how you test for it, what it is, and what to do if you do have high levels of radon. Weâre going to cover all of that information today.Radon is a cancer-causing, radioactive gas. The problem is that itâs tasteless, odorless, and invisible, but you can test for it. The Surgeon General has warned that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer today behind smoking.Â In Wisconsin, the action level for high radon is a level of 4.0 pCi/L or higher. That aligns with the EPA guidelines. The action level is not a safe level, however, as there are no safe levels of radon gas.Â âYou can fix high levels of radon via a mitigation system.âTesting is the only way to know your homeâs radon levels. There are no immediate symptoms that will alert you of the presence of radon. It typically takes years of exposure before any problems surface. If youâre dealing with a real estate transaction, your home inspector can typically also perform a radon test and get your results within a few days.If youâre a homeowner who didnât include a radon testing contingency when you made the offer on the home and youâre curious about the levels, there are many DIY testing kits that you can buy for under $20.Â If you do have high radon, you can fix the problem. Itâs best to rely on a professional, especiallyÂ  when dealing with something this dangerous. The presence of radon gas can be remediated with the installation of a radon mitigation system. These systems vent the radon gas from below the basement floor in your home and use a fan to expel the gas. These systems typically cost between $700 and $1,500 to install in your home.If you have questions for me about testing for radon or anything else related to real estate, donât hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

        "content": "Recently, Iâve been working a lot with first-time homeowners who are now looking to become first-time home sellers. As such, I wanted to share some common seller setbacks Iâve seen and how you can best prepare for them.Â If you think back to the purchase of your current home, youâll likely remember that there were several things that sent you into a panic but which turned out to be totally normal parts of the process. In hindsight, you may even laugh at how you thought something like that scary inspection report would prove to be a colossal setback. Nevertheless, knowledge is power, so here is what youâll want to know about the selling process:Â 1. Leave emotions out of the transaction. As a home seller, youâll likely experience surprisingly strong feelings about your home. Emotions may make you feel better in the short term, but feelings wonât last; always think about the big picture and your personal goals before changing course.Â 2. Make sure your home is impeccable, even before staging. You may feel very confident in your taste and decor, but itâs important to remember that anything that fills your home is a potential distraction for buyers. Itâs nothing personal, though it may feel that way.Â 3. Consider a pre-inspection before you list. A pre-listing inspection will turn up things you should definitely repair, potential problems you might not even know exist, and provide clear answers on the exact condition of your home. If youâre concerned about cost, Iâll advise you on the changes that are worth the money and the things that are likely okay to leave as is.Â 4. Handling lowball offers well. Though weâre not seeing many of these in the market of the moment, they do still occur, so itâs good to be aware of them. Thereâs a difference between an offer thatâs slightly below asking price and one thatâs tens of thousands of dollars below it.Â Lowball offers can be a form of real-time feedback about your home; if a range of buyers submit low offers, it may point to a clear issue that youâve overlooked, and therefore it forces an opportunity to address that.Â 5. Understand thatÂ everythingÂ is negotiable.Â Buyers may want all sorts of concessions and contingencies. It might be helpful to think of your home sale as another ordinary transaction, like buying a car. Negotiation in a car sale is a no brainer, so transfer that mentality to your home sale. Just as an auto dealer wouldnât accept any olâ offer, you donât have to give in on every ask, either.Â Selling your home for the first time is an opportunity to learn about real estate. The more you know before you sell, the bigger the advantage youâll have in the end; youâll be calm, focused, and determined when it comes to decisions that benefit your sale.Â If you have questions on this or any other topic, please feel free to reach out via phone or email.

        "content": "The way we work has always influenced where we live and what type of home we buy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the past year, 25% of the workforce worked from home at least part of the time. Based on the world we live in, that statistic will likely only increase. Due to remote work, weâre spending more time at home than ever before, and this is changing the criteria we use when shopping for a home.Â Specifically, remote work is changing the way people buy homes in three important ways:1. Itâs expanding the geography of the home search. Since theyâre not tied to a specific commute time to the office, buyers are looking further away from city centers to find their home. Theyâre also prioritizing lower taxes and school districts over distance from work.Â âDue to remote work, weâre spending more time at home than ever before, and this is changing the criteria we use when shopping for a home.â2. Itâs causing more buyers to look for dedicated office space. For many years, buyersâ focus centered on open concept floor plans, and many still prefer this type of floor plan. However, more and more are looking for a dedicated, private space they can make into an office. Perhaps itâs an actual office space, an additional bedroom, or extra space in the basement or attic that they can convert. Conversely, theyâre no longer prioritizing things like home gyms and theaters.Â 3. Itâs causing more buyers to settle down for the long haul. Back in the 1980s, people moved and sold their homes every five or six years. Now that average has increased to nine to 12 years. Itâs more important for modern buyers to get the space they need right now instead of moving later on to get that space.Â In closing, itâs likely that companies will continue to offer flexible working arrangements, thereby giving greater freedom to prospective buyers. Sellers who modify their listing by adding a private home office may find themselves at a great advantage.Â If you have questions about this or any real estate topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "The coronavirus pandemic is sure to have long-reaching consequences in all walks of life, but some of these consequences might surprise you.Â For example, the pandemic might completely overturn recent trends regarding where people choose to live. Over the last three decades, people have increasingly preferred cities over suburbs. Recent studies show that each new generation of young people has been more and more likely to move to cities, and many opt to stay in those cities even after getting married and starting a family.Â Post-coronavirus, this may well change. The most obvious reason is health. Urban areas are more crowded and involve more human interaction, which means greater exposure to potential viruses. Also, shelter-in-place orders are harder to bear in an urban environment. By comparison, a house in the suburbs can offer more space, a backyard, and easier access to areas where you can exercise and spend time safely outdoors.âDemand is rising, with Zillow and Realtor.com both reporting increased search traffic and buyer inquiries.âAdditionally, workplaces are changing. Many people will continue to work from home after the pandemic subsides. Along with falling gas prices, this makes long commutes a smaller issue than it had been in the past.Â A recent Harris Poll showed that 46% of city-dwellers are considering a move, compared to just 26% of suburban residents and 21% of rural residents.Â While home sales nearly came to a halt at the end of March, thatâs now changing. Demand is rising, with Zillow and Realtor.com both reporting increased search traffic and buyer inquiries. In the Madison area, I can certainly vouch for an increase in activity.Â Granted, this situation changes daily, but I stay on top of the local Madison area market. Whether youâre thinking of buying, selling, or just need some advice, give me a call or shoot me an email and Iâd be happy to guide you. I hope you and your family stay safe and healthy.Â ",

        "content": "Recently, several folks have asked me about how they can keep their families safe during the moving process right now. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, I have three tips for you to help make your move safe and healthy:1. Itâs worth spending a bit of extra money. The American Moving and Storage Association recommends passing on free, recycled boxes from supermarkets and liquor stores. Instead, get new moving boxes and packing tape. The reason is simple: Less chance of exposure to the virus. Stock up on adequate disinfectants and wipes for yourself, your moving truck, and any shared equipment you might be using.Â Â If you can afford it and it makes sense for your situation, hire a company that will handle the move for you safely and strategically. Many moving companies currently provide virtual estimates and contactless moving, which reduces risk significantly.âDisinfect high-contact points such as doorknobs and countertops.â2. Preparation is more important than ever. A move often becomes a messy and disorganized affair. Now is the time to make it as neat as possible. Pack up everything and prepare it in advance of the actual move. By minimizing moving time, youâre minimizing contact and exposure. If youâre doing the move yourself, make sure to clean the truck and any shared moving bins or boxes. If youâre hiring a moving company, then spend the time to vet them. Youâll want to know what specific measures theyâre using to deal with the pandemicâboth with their equipment and their employees.Â 3. Respect the threat. A move can be a frustrating experience. However, this is no time to throw caution to the wind and get careless. That means ongoing advice about social distancing, gloves, masks, and hygiene still applies. For example, if you are working with a moving company, make sure they have access to a sink with soap or hand sanitizer. Additionally, make sure to disinfect high-contact points such as doorknobs and countertops once the move is complete.Moving isnât always the most pleasant experience and this pandemic situation certainly doesnât help, but it is possible to move safely in todayâs market. If you have any questions about your move or real estate in general, donât hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "The human toll of the coronavirus pandemic may forever change families, yet the economic impact will rebound with a cycle of downturn followed by economic expansion, as weâve seen play out in the U.S. economy many times before.Today Iâd like to share what leading experts and current research indicate about the economic impact weâll likely see as a result of COVID-19. Letâs start with a forecast of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP).When looking at GDP (the measure of our countryâs economic health), a survey of three leading financial institutions projects a sharp decline followed by a steep rebound in the second half of this year.A recent study from John Burns Consulting notes that past pandemics have created V-shaped economic recoveries, and had minimal impact on housing prices. This certainly gives us hope and optimism regarding what is to come as this crisis passes.âThis wonât last forever, and we will get back to growth modeâweâve got this.âWith this historical analysis in mind, many business owners are also optimistically anticipating a bright economic return. A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey captures this confidence, noting 66% of surveyed business owners believe their companies will return to normal business rhythms within a month of the pandemic passing, and 90% feel they should be back to normal operation one to three months afterward.From expert financial institutions to business leaders across the country, we can clearly see that a quick return to normal once the current crisis subsides is not too far away. In essence, this pandemic wonât last forever, and we will get back to growth modeâweâve got this.Â Lives and businesses are being impacted by COVID-19, but experts do see a light at the end of the tunnel. As the economy slows down due to the health crisis, we can take the guidance and advice from experts that this too will pass.If you have any questions about real estate, please feel free to reach out via phone or email.

        "title": "5 Sweet Tax Deductions When Selling a Home",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "You may be wondering if there are tax deductions you can take when selling a home. The answer is: You bet!Sure, you may remember that 2018âs new tax codeâaka the Tax Cuts and Jobs Actâchanged some rules for homeowners. Rest assured that if you sold your home last year (or are planning to in the future), your tax deductions when you file with the IRS can still amount to sizable savings.Here are five different tax deductions you can take as a home seller:1. Selling costs. These deductions are allowed as long as they are directly tied to the sale of the home and you lived in the home for at least two out of the five years preceding the sale. Another caveat: The home must be a principal residence and not an investment property. These costs can include legal fees, title fees, advertising costs, commissions, and perhaps even staging costs. Just remember that you canât deduct these costs in the same way as, say, mortgage interest. Instead, you subtract them from the sale price of your home, which in turn positively affects your capital gains tax.âI recommend consulting with your tax advisor for further clarification.â2. Home improvements and repairs. If you renovated a few rooms to make your home more marketable (so you could fetch a higher sale price), you can deduct those upgrade costs as well. This includes painting the house or repairing the roof or water heater. Thereâs a catch, and it all boils down to timing: You can deduct those expenses as selling costs as long as they were made within 90 days of the closing.3. Property taxes. This deduction is capped at $10,000. So, if you were dutifully paying your property taxes up to the point when you sold your home, you can deduct the amount you paid in property taxes this year up to $10,000.4. Mortgage interest. As with property taxes, you can deduct the interest on your mortgage for the portion of the year you owned your home. Just remember that under the 2018 tax code, new homeowners (and home sellers) can deduct the interest on up to only $750,000 of mortgage debt. That is, unless you obtained your mortgage prior to December 15, 2017. If you did, you can deduct up to $1,000,000.Note that the mortgage interest and property taxes are itemized deductions. This means that, in order for it to work in your favor, all of your itemized deductions need to be greater than the new standard deduction.5. Capital gains tax for sellers. The rule isnât technically a deduction (itâs an exclusion), but youâre still going to like it. As a reminder, capital gains are your profits from selling your homeâwhatever cash is left after paying off your expenses, plus any outstanding mortgage debt. These profits are taxed as income, but hereâs the good news: You can exclude up to $250,000 of the capital gains from the sale if youâre single, and $500,000 if married. The only big catch is that you must have lived in your home at least two of the past five years.If you want further clarification on these five sweet tax deductions, I recommend you consult with your tax advisor. If you have any real estate-related questions for me in the meantime, donât hesitate to reach out via phone or email. Iâd love to hear from you.",

        "content": "As youâre aware, thereâs been a lot of talk in the news lately about the coronavirus, and many people have reached out to me wondering how this will impact our real estate market.Â Â When we try to predict what will happen in our local market, whether itâs due to the coronavirus or any other factor, we look to whatâs happening on our nationâs coasts, meaning markets like Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco. These are good leading indicators of trends that will eventually impact our market. When we see a shift in the luxury markets out on the coast, thatâs something weâll probably see in South Central Wisconsin sooner rather than later.Â âIf your home is valued above that or the $500,000 mark, I recommend listing it sooner rather than later.âWhether youâre buying or selling, if youâre concerned about the coronavirusâ impact on our market, my first piece of advice is to reach out to me. We can talk about your goals and formulate a strategy to accomplish them.Â If youâre a seller, one thing we do know is that the median home price in Dane County is $285,000, so if your home is valued above that or the $500,000 mark, I recommend listing it sooner rather than later. We still have limited inventory and there are plenty of buyers, so strike while the iron is hot.Â On the flip side, because of the volatility weâre seeing in the stock market due to the coronavirus, mortgage rates remain lower than last year. This is making the biggest impact below the $285,000 price point. Inventory is already tight in this market, and low interest rates will bring out more buyers and increase competition.Â What we donât want to see happen is sellers thinking now is a great time to raise prices, because that might not play out how you imagine it. Like I said, I recommend first giving me a call so we can find out what your home is worth, make a plan, and capture the attention of all the buyers out there taking advantage of these low interest rates.Â Moving forward, weâll keep an eye on this situation.

        "content": "Joe Long of Guild Mortgage joins me today to dispel some common market misconceptions and share his perspective from the lending side of things.Â Whatâs going to happen with the market in 2020 and beyond? Many homeowners remember losing value in their homes from 2008 to 2012, but since 2013 home values have been recovering. Since homes have been appreciating for so long, many believe itâs time for a market correction.Â Itâs important to understand that the market fundamentals we have now are different than the ones we had back then. Just because the marketâs been appreciating for a while doesnât mean thereâs something wrong or properties will start losing value. From 2005 to 2008, we saw rapid appreciation that was unsustainableâprices rose as high as 10% per year. Historically, home values in Dane County appreciate 3% to 4% per year. Thatâs sustainable, so if homes keep appreciating at that rate, theyâll outpace inflation and, theoretically, never cool down.Â âIf you bought a home and something were to go wrong, youâd be fine long-term.âAfter 2013, the pace of home value recovery increased rapidly, but now itâs slowing and weâre settling into a nice, pillowy landing. Last year, home values statewide rose about 5%, and this year theyâre predicted to rise between 3% and 4%. Some might see this slowdown as a bad thing, but this return to normalcy is a good thing.Â Based on the average prediction of where the marketâs headed in the next five years, if you purchased a $250,000 house now, it would appreciate by $47,500 by January 2025âa nice, slow pace.Â You need a place to live no matter what, and you can either pay your landlordâs rent or your mortgage. Only one of you is getting that appreciation, so you might as well take advantage of that equity. Many people lost a lot of money during the previous recession, but the No. 1 reason people buy houses isnât that itâs a financial investment but because they want to control where they live.Â Those who lost value starting in 2008 got it all back by 2017. If you bought a home and something were to go wrong, youâd be fine long-term. Youâll still pay off your mortgage and come out with a lot of equity. If nothing goes wrong, youâll come out way ahead.Â If you have any lending questions, feel free to give Joe a call at (608) 729-5379 or email him at jlong@guildmortgage.net.

        "content": "Iâm sure youâve heard a lot of buzz from people trying to predict when the next housing crash will be. While I do feel like thereâs a good chance that we may see a small recession or some little blips in the economy, there is also good evidence to suggest that we probably wonât see a housing crash like what happened in 2008.Â Unlike the last time that we did have a housing crash, credit has been tightened significantly. Lenders are doing their due diligence before approving home loans. The notorious subprime mortgages that helped spur the â08 crash are far from the norm in todayâs market.Â The median price in our area went up 6.4% over 2019 to $295,000, all due to a lack of inventory. Our inventory remains low because people that invest in new building projects simply arenât doing so as much. A lot of builders say they want to start on such projects, but lack the tradespeople needed to keep up with the high demand.Â âMortgage rates remain at near historic lows.âAnother reason why inventory is low boils down to demographics. A majority of the homeowners now are baby boomers, and theyâre simply holding onto their homes longer. This is squaring up directly against the millennial generation, which is primed to make the majority of home purchases in the nation. Not enough homes are available, so competition increases and prices follow suit.Â Mortgage rates remain at or near historic lows. To put this in perspective, pretend youâre in the market for a $250,000 home. If you wanted to maintain that same monthly payment that youâre budgeting for, but mortgage rates were to increase by even 1%, your buying power would be reduced to about $220,000. Move when it makes sense for your particular situation, but know that itâs always wise to take advantage of really low rates.Â If youâre trying to time your purchase by waiting for the next supposed crash, the chances are high that youâre going to miss out on opportunities. Is there a perfect time to buy or sell a home? Objectively, maybe or maybe not. Subjectively, the right time is whenever you decide.Â So if youâre ready to buy or sell real estate here in the Madison area, Iâd love a chance to talk to you. Give a call or shoot me an email so we can discuss how I can help you achieve your goals for 2020.",

        "content": "As a homeowner, itâs very important that you do an inventory of the possessions in your home in the event that something catastrophic happens to it, like a fire. Thereâs no time like the present to do this.Â Could you name the make, model, and price of all the TVs you own? Do you know where all the jewelry, trinkets, or collectibles are and how much theyâre worth? This kind of thing can add up if something catastrophic does happen to your home, and itâs definitely something you donât want to deal with.Â That being said, I have two main tips for you to remember when doing your home inventory. Â âThe last thing you want to do in the event of a home disaster is try to remember all the items you owned and estimate what they were worth.âFirst, use your smartphone to go room by room and take pictures and video of every important item you want to catalog.Â After youâre done doing that, use a cloud-based service to upload and store your photos and video. In my opinion, Google Drive works best for this. If you already have a Google account, then itâs free.

        "content": "I hope you all had a wonderful holiday and are excited for the new year. If youâre like my family, now is the time you look to declutter your home as you prepare for the coming year, and Iâve got some tips to help you do that more easily today:1. Donât wait. Donât let weeks pass by as your holiday items sit in the home without a proper place. I recommend getting on the task of decluttering right away.2. Prioritize. If youâre struggling to find a place for one or more items that you have, consider whether the items are something that you need to hold on to. There may be certain items that are important to you and your family, but there may also be other items that youâve acquired over the years that you donât really use in your annual decorating. If thatâs the case, it might be time to donate or resell those items.âA lot of your extra gift wrap and trimmings are recyclable.â3. Organize gift wrap. It can be very easy for rolls of gift wrap to get spread out and take up a lot of room. Now is a great time to go through and organize that gift wrap to make sure youâre not holding on to scraps of paper that wonât help you in the future. Maybe you could repurpose those for a craft project or something else.4. Recycle. Make sure that youâre not just tossing all of your extra gift wrap and trimmings in the trash. A lot of this stuff is recycled material and you want to properly dispose of it according to your local recycling priorities.5. Prepare for next year. You may have things that you kept in storage and didnât pull out for the holidays. I like to take this time of year to evaluate the inventory I have and see if any of them are ones I intend to hold onto in the future. Itâs also just a good time to organize your stuff so that you know where everyone is.Â If you have any questions for me about this list or real estate in general, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Recently someone approached me to ask whether buying an investment property before buying their first primary residence was a good idea, and, actually, it very well may be. Here are five reasons why:Â 1. Interest rates are low. Low interest rates mean greater purchasing power, which gives those looking to invest a unique opportunity to enjoy low monthly payments on their property.Â 2. Homes are continuing to appreciate each year. According to Core Logicâs value index, home values have increased every year for the past seven years. And, according to most experts, real estate is one of the safest (and wisest) investments.âIf you ever tire of renting your property out, or if youâre simply ready to become a homeowner, yourself, there is always the option for you to move into the home.â3. Real estate investing creates passive income. Beyond just having someone else cover the expense of your monthly payments, renting out a property means that you can rely on your investment to generate passive income, as well.Â 4. Short-term rentals are popular right now. Even if you arenât interested in being a long-term landlord, short-term rentals are in high demand right now. Airbnb and VRBO have opened up numerous options for investors. Your investment property also doesnât need to be local. You can purchase a rental property in a tourist âhot spotâ and have someone else manage it for you.Â 5. You can turn the investment into your primary residence later on. If you ever tire of renting your property out, or if youâre simply ready to become a homeowner, yourself, there is always the option for you to move into the home.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "The temperature is dropping, leaves are changing color, and pumpkin spice is everywhere you look. With fall color and produce back in season, you might be tempted to load up your house with both. However, if you plan to sell your home this fall, you might want to exercise some restraint. In the eyes of buyers, less is more. Here are four tips to consider:Â 1. Pay attention to your fall-themed curb appeal. While too many fall decorations can distract attention away from your homeâs best features, a few tasteful accents can produce an inviting atmosphere. Take the time to rake and round up fallen leaves and do general yard care. Buyers may give you a pass if they see your lawn is blanketed with leaves, but that doesnât mean your home will make a good impression.Â âWhile too many fall decorations can distract attention away from your homeâs best features, a few tasteful accents can produce an inviting atmosphere.â2. Go easy on the gory Halloween decorations. Decorating your home with fake blood, guts, and skeletons might just be part of getting into the holiday spirit for you, but you never know what kind of reaction youâll get from buyers. Some may be amused, but some may be frightened, and anything that has the potential to turn off a buyer is a no-no when listing your home. Play it safe with your decor choices, so you can appeal to the masses.Â 3. Let in the light. Itâs always a good idea to pull back the curtains and allow natural light to help you showcase your home. With shorter days in the fall and winter, you want to make sure you maximize the amount of light flooding into your home. This way, your home will appear larger.Â 4. Make the space inviting. As the weather cools off, a warm and cozy atmosphere will give buyers a warm and cozy feeling. Place plush throws on your couch and beds and add fall-accented pillows to your couch and chairs as well.Â If you have any questions about selling your home or about real estate in general, or thereâs a topic youâd like me to cover in a future video, feel free to give me a call at 608-345-6594 or you can email me at JDHolt@KW.com.

Here are eight helpful tips that you can use to keep your yard in good shape:1. Â Fertilization and weed control. This helps reduce the stress your lawn will endure over the summer, and weed control will take care of those fall weeds as well.Â 2. Aerate your yard. It should be overseeded as well. Aeration prepares it for winter and promotes healthy growth for spring. Overseeding helps fill in any bare spots and helps your lawn recover from the summer.3. Rake and pick up leaves. This will reduce possible insect and disease damage over the winter. Itâs also a good time to remove any dead or unsafe branches in your yard.âRoots have a better chance to establish in the fall.â4. The final mow of the season. Set your mower to the lowest height recommended for your grass on the last mow of the year to reduce the ability of diseases to affect them in the winter.5. Plant trees and shrubs. In the fall, it gives roots a chance to establish in a lower-stress, moist environment.6. Cut back and divide perennials. This will result in a more established plant next spring.7. Add some fall color. Hearty mums are a great choice.8. Plant spring bulbs. To ensure vibrant, early spring color in your landscaping, be sure to plant your bulbs in the fall.If you have any questions for me about these tips or about anything else related to real estate, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "To be honest, purchasing new construction isnât all that different from purchasing an existing home in an established neighborhood. Of course, for either purchase, thereâs a lot of value that having the support of a professional agent can bring you when making such an important (and expensive) decision.If you visited a model home on the weekend and talked to the on-site sales agent, you likely wouldnât be talking to an agent who had your best interests at heart. What I mean by that is that particular agent is likely employed by or represents the builder and their fiduciary responsibility is to them.When you hire an agent of your own, you get the advocacy of someone who does have your best interests at heart and who will help you navigate the intricacies of negotiation, paperwork, terms, conditions, and every other aspect of the real estate process in order to ensure that youâre getting the best benefits from your purchase.For example, builders may offer discounts, savings, or incentives if you work with their lender or select specific upgrades and finishes; as agents in your corner, weâll make sure that those incentives truly are savings and wonât come back to bite you later on.âAs agents in your corner, weâll make sure that the builderâs incentives truly are savings and wonât come back to bite you later on.âSomething else to take into consideration is how long you plan to live in the home. If, for whatever reason, this home ends up not being your forever home and you decide to resell it later on,Â your agent can also advise you on which upgrades you can do to increase your future resale value and which ones may actually decrease or not improve that value.One of the biggest things an agent on your side can help you with isÂ researching the builder: how they work, the quality of their products, their building programs, the incentives they offer, and their sales history.And finally,Â it typically doesnât cost you any extra money to hire an agent like myself to represent you.Â Like any seller in a real estate transaction, the builder will be the one who ends up paying for your agentâs commission. If youâre not working with an agent, donât assume they will just pass that difference on to you as cost savings, often they may use that money instead for marketing or just for profit. Iâve found that most of the builders in our market are âagent-friendlyâ and like working with buyers that have representation; the key thing is that we, the agents, need to be the ones who introduce you to the builder, not the other way around. If you have more questions on that, send me a message and we can talk more.If you see value in having an agent like myself represent you in the purchase of a new construction property, and are looking to buy a brand-new home, reach out to us.

        "content": "Thereâs a common misconception among sellers (and even some real estate agents) that all it takes to sell a home is to stick a sign in the yard and wait for the offers to roll in. However, this couldnât be further from the truth. Many sellers who attempt this route end up with expired listings.So what do you do after this has happened to you? What does it take to make your second attempt at listing successful?First, itâs important to realize that youâre not alone. Year to Date in Dane County, 10.68% of single-family home listings and 6.46% of all condo listings expired.Â But why?There are actually a number of factors that can contribute to a listingâs success (or its failure). Chief among these factors are price, condition, and location, but also marketing. The marketing an agent uses to advertise a home can make or break its ability to sell.Â âYour agent needs to actively seek out buyers, rather than waiting for buyers to come to them.âAn effective marketing plan must include professional photography (and videography), an enticing description on its online listing, and adequate exposure. Your agent should use every available method to reach buyers, including social media advertising, print advertising, open houses, among other things.Â Proactive prospecting, in particular, is critical. In other words, your agent needs to actively seek out buyers, rather than waiting for buyers to come to them.Â If the agent youâre working with canât do these things for you and your home, then itâs time to seek out a more experienced, knowledgeable professional. Our team would be happy to fill that role for you. So, if you or someone you know is looking to sell, please reach out to us.

        "content": "Just the other day, a renter I know whoâs never been a homeowner asked me an interesting question: Is homeownership still one of the greatest ways to secure oneâs financial future? The answer is a resounding yes.Â When youâre stepping into the market to buy a home for the first time, itâs easy to fix your attention on price and what your monthly mortgage payment will be, and understandably so.Â Up to this point, youâve known exactly how much you were going to pay in rent each month, and now youâre trying to figure out how much house you can afford given your monthly budget.Beyond price and your monthly payment, itâs also important to think about the homeâs future value, or appreciation, over the life of your mortgage. When you sell your home, the majority of your profits will come from the equity youâve gained between the time you bought the home and the years youâve lived in the home.Â Although the market ebbs and flows and home values can ebb and flow with it, the value of real estate is always increasing, and thereâs no real indication that will change anytime soon.âThe sooner you start paying off your mortgage, the better your financial circumstances will be later in life.âAnother advantage of becoming a homeowner early in life is that, more than likely, youâll be able to pay off your mortgage during your working years. When you enter into retirement on a fixed income, having to continue paying on a mortgage can interfere with your ability to maintain your desired lifestyle. The sooner you start paying off your mortgage, the better your financial circumstances will be later in life.Finally, for those who struggle to save money, owning a home is a means by which you can achieve this. Think of it as a kind of forced savings. As a homeowner, youâll be forced to put away enough money to stay on top of your mortgage, cover your monthly expenses, and so on. All the while, your homeâs value will grow, and that equity will pay dividends when you sell it down the line.Â If you have any questions about our local market or real estate in general or if thereâs a topic youâd like me to cover in a future video, reach out to me by phone at 608-345-6594 or you can email me at JDHolt@KW.com.

        "content": "Whatâs the latest news on our Dane County market and beyond? Â Much like the last few months and years, weâre seeing a scarcity of inventory in certain segments of our market. Conditions continue to bode well for sellers, but weâre also seeing some changes that may signal greater opportunities for buyers.Â Recently, Dane County has seen an uptick in the number of homes on the market, both in terms of single-family homes and condos: 1,000 single-family properties and 225 condos are currently listed.Â Another recent development is homes are spending more time on the market. For single-family homes, the average days on market is 67 days, and the average condo is sitting on the market for a little over 120 days. Â Iâm constantly being asked about inventory and justifiably so. The amount of inventory we have is a prime indicator of whether weâre in a sellerâs market, a buyerâs market, or a balanced market. Weâre firmly in a sellerâs market at the moment, and though our inventory situation is showing modest signs of going the opposite direction or toward a balanced state, weâre still nowhere near where weâd like to be. Â In the up-to-$200,000 price point, we have just 0.85 monthsâ worth of inventory, which means homes priced around there are flying off the market. When we move up to the $200,000 to $350,000 range, inventory is slightly higher with 1.4 monthsâ worth. Inventory doubles in the $350,000 to $500,000 range, and rises still in the luxury market to 5.3 monthsâ worth.Â âConditions continue to bode well for sellers, but weâre also seeing some changes that may signal greater opportunities for buyers.âAs for median sales price, single-family homes are selling for $319,000 right now. Contrast that with the median price for these homes in the spring, which was $300,000. The median sale price for condos has slightly increased to $200,000.Â Now, I know not everyone lives in or is focused on the numbers for Dane County, so letâs quickly run through the numbers for the larger South Central Wisconsin region:  Regional inventory is at 2.8 monthsâ worth  Regional median sales price for single-family homes has fallen a bit to $232,000  Regional median sales price for condos is at about $190,000Â Lastly and surprisingly, our interest rates are still unbelievably low: Theyâre currently sub-4% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Even as home prices increase, itâs still a great time to get into a new home and secure an interest rate in the low-4% range. Â Â If youâre a seller whoâs looking to move up, our current market is rife with opportunities to do so. Youâll find that conditions are favorable to sell your home, and the availability of homes provides more flexibility for you as a buyer as well.Â If you have any questions about the areaâs real estate market or if thereâs a topic youâd like me to feature on a future video, reach out to me by phone at 608-345-6594 or by email at JDHolt@KW.com.

Luckily, Iâm here to give you a few tips on how to navigate the process.First, talk to your lender. Before you even begin to look at homes, you should make sure that all of your finances are in order. Youâll want to ensure that nothing has changed in your financial picture that youâre not aware of and to figure out your options.Â âBefore you even begin to look at homes, you should make sure that all of your finances are in order.âThere are three ways to go about handling both these transactions at once:1. Sell your current home first. To do this, youâll need to list your home on the market at an appropriate price that you know will help it sell quickly. This can be an advantageous way to go about it, since a lot of sellers will be hesitant to accept an offer thatâs contingent on you selling your current home.Once you close on the sale of your current home, you could potentially do a rent-back agreement, in which the purchasers of your home agree to let you live there for a predetermined period of time for rent. This would allow you time to find and purchase a new home to move into.2. Buy your new home first. In this situation, you might be saddled with two concurrent mortgages, so it may not be ideal, depending on your financial situation.3. Buy and sell in the same day. It might be tricky, but it is possible to plan things in such a way that you can close on the sale of your current home and the purchase of your new home in the same day. Of course, this doesnât give you much time to move, so you may have to plan ahead.If you have any questions about todayâs topic or about the local real estate market, feel free to reach out to me.

        "content": "When youâre a home seller looking to create the best first impression on potential buyers, there are a number of different strategies to follow:1. Start by improving the curb appeal. Start from the street and work your way in. This includes looking at things like your driveway, the exterior landscaping, and the exterior of the home in general. Look at the outside of the property from a buyerâs perspective to make sure that it looks the best it possibly can. This way, when potential buyers drive or walk by the home, theyâll get the impression your home is well-maintained.2. Have a clean entryway. Make sure that your doormat is clean, your front door is freshly painted and presentable, and that your doorbell is in working order. The color of your door should complement your home, and if possible, the neighborhood at large.3. Eliminate any odors. You donât want potential buyers to walk into your home, only to be smacked in the face by the odor of pets, cigarette smoke, and even chemical smellsâbe careful to limit your use of deodorizers and fragrances, which can turn off potential buyers. The key when it comes to scent is balance.âBe careful to limit your use of deodorizers and fragrances, which can turn off potential buyers.â4. Deep clean the house. If you really want to create a great first impression, youâll need to take the time to deep clean your entire home, meaning you should clean the carpets, floors, and all other surfaces. And donât forget to dust! You donât want to give buyers the impression that youâre not maintaining your home as well as you could be. They may wonder if there are other areas youâre neglecting when it comes to home care.5. Declutter your home. You donât want to have various piles of your possessions lying around the home, especially if they take up floor space. Be sure to clean out and organize your storage areas, like your closets and cabinets. This is a good time to go through your things and purge those items you no longer need, want, or use. This will make your home seem neater and more accessible to a buyer.6. Repaint. Now, I donât mean that you need to repaint the entire exterior or interior of your home, although there are studies that show you can recoup one-and-a-half to two times your investment in your resale price if you do. What Iâm focusing on here, though, is making sure that youâve touched up any nicks, dings, or chips in your paint. Be sure to use a neutral color palette if you want to appeal to the widest pool of buyers!If youâre thinking about selling your home in todayâs market and you have any questions about what you can do to sell quickly and for top dollar, feel free to reach out to me.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Downsizing is the process of moving from a larger home to a smaller one. Why might people do this? As it turns out, there are many reasons:Most often, people downsize when there has been a life-changing occurrence, such as when the kids graduate and move away, or maybe youâre on the verge of retirement.Â It could also be that you just realize that managing a home of a certain size is more work, stress, and money than you can handle, and so a smaller home simply seems more feasible for you. This is especially true for elderly homeowners, and even for those who lead lifestyles that are simply too busy to allow them to juggle home maintenance with their lives.âIf youâre on a larger lot that requires continuous landscaping and maintenance, perhaps that means itâs time to look for something a little more manageable.âEspecially for those whose kids have moved away from home, another reason to downsize is the realization that you just have too much space that you donât use. That goes for the outside, as well; if youâre on a larger lot that requires continuous landscaping and maintenance, perhaps that means itâs time to look for something a little more manageable.Â Lastly, there are financial benefits to downsizing your home. If youâve lived in your home for a long time, youâve probably built up a fair amount of equity. Now could be the most opportune time to put your home on the market and make the move using the money you have tied up in the home.If you have any questions or comments about downsizing, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to hear from you.",

        "title": "Selling on Your Own vs. Hiring a Real Estate Professional",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "When youâre weighing the decision to hire a real estate professional to help you sell your home versus just doing it by yourself, there are four key points to keep in mind that will help you make your final decision about which route to go:1. Contracts and paperwork. Regardless of whoâs doing the selling, youâre still entering into a legally binding contract with the other party when you do sell it. If youâre not using a real estate professional to help you, youâll want to have a real estate attorney review the contracts for you so that you can be sure that your transaction is legally compliant.2. Marketing your home. The goal of most sellers is to get their listing in front of as many qualified buyersâ eyes as possible. In this day and age, you can do a lot on your own to give your listing exposure, particularly with social media. However, did you know that there are literally thousands of websites out there that real estate professionals post your listings to if you work with them? Chances are you donât have the time or resources to post to that many sites!âSelling a home is about more than just the dollars and centsâyou also need to think about the amount of time you have to dedicate to the logistics.â3. Pricing your home accurately. The reality is that you only have one shot to make a great initial impression. If you price your home too high when you first put it on the market, it will probably sit stagnant on the market, causing people to wonder whatâs wrong with it. Itâs a surefire way to reduce the amount of activity your home will see. The same is true if you price it too low. Many people like to go online to check home values, but thereâs really no better way to get the true value of your home than to talk to a real estate professional (like myself). We can do a comparative market analysis (CMA) to help you discern what people would be willing to pay for your home.4. The value of your time. A lot of folks donât always think of how much time it takes to sell a home. Regardless of whether you sell yours on your own or if you hire an agent, there are things youâll need to do in order to make sure the sale goes your way, like getting the property in show-ready condition. When you work with a real estate professional, theyâll handle all the particulars of the transaction for you, like scheduling showings and negotiating with the buyers and their agents. You likely have your own career to deal with, and you probably wonât be available when a buyer wants to see your home. Further still, we vet your buyers to make sure theyâre qualified to actually be able to purchase the home. Selling a home is about more than just the dollars and centsâyou also need to think about the amount of time you have to dedicate to the logistics.If you have any questions about todayâs topic or if youâre in need of a real estate professional to help you with your own home sale, feel free to give me a call or send an email. Iâd be glad to hear from you.",

        "title": "4 Buyer Tips for Navigating Our Current Market",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "These four tips will aid you in better navigating the current real estate market as a homebuyer:1. Consider submitting a larger earnest money deposit with your offer. There might not be an industry standard for this, but the earnest money is a good faith deposit that accompanies your offer and will speak volumes about your enthusiasm and seriousness about buying the property. By putting in a few thousand dollars extra, then, youâll let the seller know that youâre a strong and serious buyer.Â 2. Show the sellers that you are qualified to purchase their home. Probably most important of all, you need to show that youâve taken the steps to meet with a lender and not only get pre-qualified, but pre-approved as well. A pre-approval, again, solidly demonstrates that youâre a serious and able buyer. Â âPut your best foot forward when making your offer to the extent that youâre comfortable.â3. Give the sellers time to move and find out what terms are important to them. With good communication, your agent can help you with this. Whether the seller wants to have an expedient close and move-out or they need extra time, itâll look good if you can accommodate the timetable that works best for them.Â 4. Write your best offer! In this momentâs market, it wonât serve you well to write a lowball offer in the hopes that youâll negotiate higher. Instead of counting on the sellerâs willingness to negotiate and counter back, put your best foot forward when making your offer to the extent that youâre comfortable. In other words, decide how high youâre willing to go, so that if the home sold for more than that, youâd be comfortable walking away. Most sellers wonât have the appetite to go back and forth if another buyer sets themselves apart by making their best offer from the outset.Â If youâre looking to purchase a home in the Greater Madison area, Iâd be happy to help. Iâm an Accredited Buyerâs Representative, which means I have additional education to best help buyers navigate the market of the moment. Letâs make your dream of homeownership come true!

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Thereâs not really a one-size-fits-all answer to the question, âHow is the market?â It depends on whether youâre looking to buy or sell, what your price point is, where youâre looking to live, and much more. These factors all play a part, so letâs see what the latest numbers have to say for each.In the Greater Dane County area, weâre expecting home prices to increase. Right now, the median price of a single-family home is $300,000, and condos are around $195,000.Inventory is illustrated in terms of how many months it would take for all currently listed homes to sell. Six months of inventory is a balanced market; anything above that is a buyerâs market, and anything below is a sellerâs market.Â âUltimately, itâs still a great market for buyers and sellers alike.âAs of now, we have an average of 1.5 monthsâ worth of inventory. Homes in the $200,000 price range only have two weeks of inventory. The $200,000 to $350,000 range has one month of inventory. At $350,000 to $500,000, there are 2.5 months of inventoryâthings tend to soften as price points increase. Over $500,000, there are 4.5 months of inventory.There are about 800 single-family homes currently on the market. On average, they take 87 days to sell. Interest rates are in the low 4% range for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, so ultimately, itâs still a great market for buyers and sellers alike.Making the most out of our market, however, depends on who you have working as your real estate professional. Iâd be more than happy to help you find a great deal on the perfect home or make a sale for top dollar. If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out to me.

			<p>Iâm Joshua Holt, a licensed full-service REALTORÂ® and Broker and Founder of the Holt Real Estate Team. I work in partnership with Keller Williams Realty, representing buyers and sellers. Iâve proudly served our country, and now I proudly serve the communities throughout Dane County and South Central Wisconsin. I love working with Keller Williams, the #1 name in real estate. I believe strongly is having a growth mindset which is why I invest in weekly coaching with our MAPS coaching division as well as being a multiple time graduate of their BOLD coaching course. Iâm honored to serve on our officeâs Agent Leadership Council as well as being a member of both the KW Military and KW New Homes divisions.</p>
