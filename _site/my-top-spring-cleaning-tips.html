<p>Whether youâre thinking about listing your home for sale this spring or youâre already in your forever home, these spring cleaning tips can be of value to any homeowner:Â </p>

<p><strong>1. Windows.</strong> Make sure that you take time to clean not only the outsides of your windows but also the insides; buyers will check out both.Â </p>

<p><strong>2. Curb appeal.</strong> Walk around the perimeter of your home and tackle any areas that need to be cleaned, trimmed, or repainted. Oftentimes, youâll find debris and buildup leftover from winter. Also, take a look at your front doorâhas it seen better days? A fresh coat of paint could bring it back to life.Â </p>

<p>When was the last time you truly looked at the address numbers on your house? Straighten them if theyâre misaligned and make sure theyâre not faded. While youâre at it, test your exterior lights to make sure everything is in working order.Â </p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/home/?status=The kitchen receives a lot of traffic, so it should receive some extra attention when cleaning.%20http://localhost:4000/my-top-spring-cleaning-tips.html%20via%40" target="_blank" class="pullquote">âThe kitchen receives a lot of traffic, so it should receive some extra attention when cleaning.â</a></p>

<p><strong>3. Kitchen.</strong> This is easily the top priority inside your home. Focus on your appliances; do a good refrigerator and freezer clean-out, run a clean cycle on the dishwasher, etc. The kitchen receives a lot of traffic, so it should receive some extra attention when cleaning.Â </p>

<p><strong>4. Bathrooms.</strong> No one likes deep cleaning toilets, sinks, and tile floors, but itâs a must. If you have fabric shower curtains, run those through a gentle wash cycle. Or, if yours are older shower curtains, perhaps itâs time to replace them.Â </p>

<p>Of course, these are just some great starting points; we have a fairly comprehensive spring cleaning checklist that weâd be more than happy to share with you. If youâre interested in receiving a copy of that or have any questions about the spring selling season, give us a call or send an email. Weâd love to hear from you and find out how we can be of service.</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">We had a great experience with the Holt Real Estate team. This was our first time buying a home and werenât sure what to expect or what to look for in a real estate agent. Our lender offered to connect us with an agent who had experience with our loan type (VA loan) and we accepted. Jonathan contacted me within an hour with questions about what we wanted in a home and immediately had us set up into their portal with potential listings. Two days later we found our home, put in an offer, and had it accepted. Home buying can be stressful but the Holt teams was available anytime we had a question or needed guidance. They even met us for an extra showing so our son could see the home. We mostly worked with Jonathan but Joshua was there along the way to answer questions and offer his experience. Savannah sent us weekly updates on where we were at in the process and was quick to respond when I reached out. The Holt team made a very stressful process that much easier and I felt confident that they had my familyâs best interests at heart. We will absolutely use them again in the future.</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">I was renting out a condo that I owned in Stoughton, when my renters decided not to renew their lease I decided it was time to sell my investment property! Originally I had wanted to use a flat fee service and do the majority of the work myself, it was the best way to make the most profit â but when Josh messaged me and asked if I would meet with him I figured it was worth a shot â I know NOTHING about real estate! When we met, he came prepared with lots of paperwork including comparible properties in the area that had sold and a print out showing me the potential profit based on the sale price. The best thing Josh did was provide proof of comparible sales, because he recommended that I list $15,000 MORE than I was intending to list. My property was vacant â Josh held 3 open houses the first weekend it was listed and I accepted an offer of $1500 OVER list price ($16,500 over what I was planning to list at) on the 4th day it was on the market.</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">When I was searching for a new place to live in June, I happened to be put in the capable hands of Joshua at Keller Williams. I was panicked and didnât have much money to buy a place and he constantly reassured me about how he would do anything to help me find a place or with anything Iâd need. The very first day I went looking for a Condo with Joshua, I wanted to see a number of places but figured Joshua had other appointments and would never have time to show me different places. But, I was wrong for Joshua took me to every place I wanted to see and even back to a place we already looked at just to make sure. Well, the place we saw again was what I could afford and we made an offer on it. We even made a lower offer to see if it would be accepted. It was accepted and the ball was rolling. I was then getting more nervous each day as the offer was accepted. Frequently I would get a reassuring call from Joshua calming my fears about finances.</p>

Josh is an amazing realtor. When buying your first home everyone makes the process look so easy from finding the perfect home to getting financing. But that is not at all the experience we had. I think we hit about every bump in the road but Josh was amazing through this process from keeping us posted via phone call or text message to just being there for moral support. Josh was also awesome about meeting on our time. My husband works 2 retail jobs so finding time to meet with Josh sometimes had to be scheduled out and he was so good about getting times that worked for us and working them into his schedule even if it was a phone call while he was driving home at night. No doubt if we decide to sell our house and find a new one we are going with Josh again!!</p>

He talked us through everything when we got forms or documents and even wanted to meet in person to go over different things. That helped us feel more comfortable throughout the whole process. He would check in every once and awhile just to see how we were and if we had any questions. He also went above and beyond and checked to ensure that our house was safe and secure when we were gone on vacation. We would recommend Josh to anyone trying to sell a house, he's great!!</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">We had a great experience with the Holt Real Estate team. This was our first time buying a home and werenât sure what to expect or what to look for in a real estate agent. Our lender offered to connect us with an agent who had experience with our loan type (VA loan) and we accepted. Jonathan contacted me within an hour with questions about what we wanted in a home and immediately had us set up into their portal with potential listings. Two days later we found our home, put in an offer, and had it accepted.<br> Home buying can be stressful but the Holt teams was available anytime we had a question or needed guidance. They even met us for an extra showing so our son could see the home. We mostly worked with Jonathan but Joshua was there along the way to answer questions and offer his experience. Savannah sent us weekly updates on where we were at in the process and was quick to respond when I reached out. The Holt team made a very stressful process that much easier and I felt confident that they had my familyâs best interests at heart. We will absolutely use them again in the future.</p>
