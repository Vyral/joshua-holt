        <description>

As you’re aware, there’s been a lot of talk in the news lately about the coronavirus, and many people have reached out to me wondering how this will impact our real estate market.  

When we try to predict what will happen in our local market, whether it’s due to the coronavirus or any other factor, we look to what’s happening on our nation’s coasts, meaning markets like Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco. These are good leading indicators of trends that will eventually impact our market. When we see a shift in the luxury markets out on the coast, that’s something we’ll probably see in South Central Wisconsin sooner rather than later. 

“If your home is valued above that or the $500,000 mark, I recommend listing it sooner rather than later.”

Whether you’re buying or selling, if you’re concerned about the coronavirus’ impact on our market, my first piece of advice is to reach out to me. We can talk about your goals and formulate a strategy to accomplish them. 

If you’re a seller, one thing we do know is that the median home price in Dane County is $285,000, so if your home is valued above that or the $500,000 mark, I recommend listing it sooner rather than later. We still have limited inventory and there are plenty of buyers, so strike while the iron is hot. 

On the flip side, because of the volatility we’re seeing in the stock market due to the coronavirus, mortgage rates remain lower than last year. This is making the biggest impact below the $285,000 price point. Inventory is already tight in this market, and low interest rates will bring out more buyers and increase competition. 

What we don’t want to see happen is sellers thinking now is a great time to raise prices, because that might not play out how you imagine it. Like I said, I recommend first giving me a call so we can find out what your home is worth, make a plan, and capture the attention of all the buyers out there taking advantage of these low interest rates. 

Moving forward, we’ll keep an eye on this situation. If you have any questions about this topic at all, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’m here to help.

Joe Long of Guild Mortgage joins me today to dispel some common market misconceptions and share his perspective from the lending side of things. 

What’s going to happen with the market in 2020 and beyond? Many homeowners remember losing value in their homes from 2008 to 2012, but since 2013 home values have been recovering. Since homes have been appreciating for so long, many believe it’s time for a market correction. 

It’s important to understand that the market fundamentals we have now are different than the ones we had back then. Just because the market’s been appreciating for a while doesn’t mean there’s something wrong or properties will start losing value. From 2005 to 2008, we saw rapid appreciation that was unsustainable—prices rose as high as 10% per year. Historically, home values in Dane County appreciate 3% to 4% per year. That’s sustainable, so if homes keep appreciating at that rate, they’ll outpace inflation and, theoretically, never cool down. 

“If you bought a home and something were to go wrong, you’d be fine long-term.”

After 2013, the pace of home value recovery increased rapidly, but now it’s slowing and we’re settling into a nice, pillowy landing. Last year, home values statewide rose about 5%, and this year they’re predicted to rise between 3% and 4%. Some might see this slowdown as a bad thing, but this return to normalcy is a good thing. 

Based on the average prediction of where the market’s headed in the next five years, if you purchased a $250,000 house now, it would appreciate by $47,500 by January 2025—a nice, slow pace. 

You need a place to live no matter what, and you can either pay your landlord’s rent or your mortgage. Only one of you is getting that appreciation, so you might as well take advantage of that equity. Many people lost a lot of money during the previous recession, but the No. 1 reason people buy houses isn’t that it’s a financial investment but because they want to control where they live. 

Those who lost value starting in 2008 got it all back by 2017. If you bought a home and something were to go wrong, you’d be fine long-term. You’ll still pay off your mortgage and come out with a lot of equity. If nothing goes wrong, you’ll come out way ahead. 

If you have any lending questions, feel free to give Joe a call at (608) 729-5379 or email him at jlong@guildmortgage.net. If you have any other questions about the real estate market, don’t hesitate to call or email me anytime. I’d love to help you.

Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to go to our state capitol building for the annual Realtor® and Government Day. Today, I’m sharing my experience by recapping the three main topics discussed at the event, as well as sharing my insight on these matters. 

Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to skip to topics that interest you most: 

1:29 - The issue of riparian water rights (2018 supreme court case regarding homeowners’ right to build a pier)

3:33 - Legislation in the works prohibiting the habit of “chasing sales” 

4:45 - The lack of workforce housing in our area and proposed remedies

 6:20 - Wrapping things up 

If you’re interested in discussing these important topics in more detail, please feel free to reach out by phone or email. I’d love the opportunity to inform the homeowners in our great state and gain different perspectives on these issues.

        <description>

Most markets around the country have been experiencing historically low inventory, meaning that there just aren’t that many homes for sale in first-time homebuyers’ price ranges. It’s not that uncommon for a first-timer to end up in competition with one or even 10 other buyers, so we’ve become pretty crafty and strategic to make our buyers’ offers stand out to the seller. To help me lay out some potential roadmaps to success, Joe Long from Guild Mortgage joins me to discuss some of the strategies that he has seen work for homebuyers in our tricky seller’s market.

Feel free to follow along in the video above or else use the timestamps below to navigate the discussion in depth at your leisure:

1:28—Find out what’s important to the seller

2:48—Consider your offer’s terms and contingencies

4:08—Use a TBD underwrite

5:52—Appraisal forgiveness and a few other tactics to entice a seller to accept your offer

Remember, for a home seller, the most important thing isn’t always pricing. Using a combination of these strategies can help you stand out from the crowd and win the home you want in our market.

If you’re in the market to buy a home and you’d like to learn more about how we can help you beat the competition for a home you have your sights set on, reach out to us by phone or email. We’d be glad to help you discover tools and tricks to help you succeed in your goals.

        <description>

I’m sure you’ve heard a lot of buzz from people trying to predict when the next housing crash will be. While I do feel like there’s a good chance that we may see a small recession or some little blips in the economy, there is also good evidence to suggest that we probably won’t see a housing crash like what happened in 2008. 

Unlike the last time that we did have a housing crash, credit has been tightened significantly. Lenders are doing their due diligence before approving home loans. The notorious subprime mortgages that helped spur the ‘08 crash are far from the norm in today’s market. 

The median price in our area went up 6.4% over 2019 to $295,000, all due to a lack of inventory. Our inventory remains low because people that invest in new building projects simply aren’t doing so as much. A lot of builders say they want to start on such projects, but lack the tradespeople needed to keep up with the high demand. 

“Mortgage rates remain at near historic lows.”

Another reason why inventory is low boils down to demographics. A majority of the homeowners now are baby boomers, and they’re simply holding onto their homes longer. This is squaring up directly against the millennial generation, which is primed to make the majority of home purchases in the nation. Not enough homes are available, so competition increases and prices follow suit. 

Mortgage rates remain at or near historic lows. To put this in perspective, pretend you’re in the market for a $250,000 home. If you wanted to maintain that same monthly payment that you’re budgeting for, but mortgage rates were to increase by even 1%, your buying power would be reduced to about $220,000. Move when it makes sense for your particular situation, but know that it’s always wise to take advantage of really low rates. 

If you’re trying to time your purchase by waiting for the next supposed crash, the chances are high that you’re going to miss out on opportunities. Is there a perfect time to buy or sell a home? Objectively, maybe or maybe not. Subjectively, the right time is whenever you decide. 

So if you’re ready to buy or sell real estate here in the Madison area, I’d love a chance to talk to you. Give a call or shoot me an email so we can discuss how I can help you achieve your goals for 2020.

        <description>

As a homeowner, it’s very important that you do an inventory of the possessions in your home in the event that something catastrophic happens to it, like a fire. There’s no time like the present to do this. 

Could you name the make, model, and price of all the TVs you own? Do you know where all the jewelry, trinkets, or collectibles are and how much they’re worth? This kind of thing can add up if something catastrophic does happen to your home, and it’s definitely something you don’t want to deal with. 

That being said, I have two main tips for you to remember when doing your home inventory.  

“The last thing you want to do in the event of a home disaster is try to remember all the items you owned and estimate what they were worth.”

First, use your smartphone to go room by room and take pictures and video of every important item you want to catalog. 

After you’re done doing that, use a cloud-based service to upload and store your photos and video. In my opinion, Google Drive works best for this. If you already have a Google account, then it’s free. It has quite a bit of storage, and you can also utilize Google Sheets to further itemize your possessions. 

Like I said, the last thing you want to do in the event of a home disaster is to try to remember all the items you owned and estimate what they were worth. 

If you have more questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

        <description>

I hope you all had a wonderful holiday and are excited for the new year. If you’re like my family, now is the time you look to declutter your home as you prepare for the coming year, and I’ve got some tips to help you do that more easily today:

1. Don’t wait. Don’t let weeks pass by as your holiday items sit in the home without a proper place. I recommend getting on the task of decluttering right away.

2. Prioritize. If you’re struggling to find a place for one or more items that you have, consider whether the items are something that you need to hold on to. There may be certain items that are important to you and your family, but there may also be other items that you’ve acquired over the years that you don’t really use in your annual decorating. If that’s the case, it might be time to donate or resell those items.

“A lot of your extra gift wrap and trimmings are recyclable.”

3. Organize gift wrap. It can be very easy for rolls of gift wrap to get spread out and take up a lot of room. Now is a great time to go through and organize that gift wrap to make sure you’re not holding on to scraps of paper that won’t help you in the future. Maybe you could repurpose those for a craft project or something else.

4. Recycle. Make sure that you’re not just tossing all of your extra gift wrap and trimmings in the trash. A lot of this stuff is recycled material and you want to properly dispose of it according to your local recycling priorities.

5. Prepare for next year. You may have things that you kept in storage and didn’t pull out for the holidays. I like to take this time of year to evaluate the inventory I have and see if any of them are ones I intend to hold onto in the future. It’s also just a good time to organize your stuff so that you know where everyone is. 

If you have any questions for me about this list or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

If you’re a low- to moderate-income buyer, or just someone without a significant down payment saved up, then a USDA loan might be the perfect path to homeownership for you. 

The USDA loan program allows homeowners to purchase a qualifying rural property for no money down. Like any mortgage option, you will need to meet certain criteria, though. The primary qualifying factors are your income, for which limits will vary by area, as well as the location of the property.

“The bottom line is that the USDA loan is a great option for those savvy enough to take advantage.”

You can click here to learn more and for access to a loan availability map showing what properties near you may qualify. 

Homes located within Stoughton city limits, for example, are ineligible, but areas just to the north (near Madison) do qualify—as do properties in the Village of McFarland, the Village of Oregon, Deforest/Windsor/ Mount Horeb, Cambridge, and many other municipalities. 

The bottom line is that the USDA loan is a great option for those savvy enough to take advantage. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Recently someone approached me to ask whether buying an investment property before buying their first primary residence was a good idea, and, actually, it very well may be. Here are five reasons why: 

1. Interest rates are low. Low interest rates mean greater purchasing power, which gives those looking to invest a unique opportunity to enjoy low monthly payments on their property. 

2. Homes are continuing to appreciate each year. According to Core Logic’s value index, home values have increased every year for the past seven years. And, according to most experts, real estate is one of the safest (and wisest) investments.

“If you ever tire of renting your property out, or if you’re simply ready to become a homeowner, yourself, there is always the option for you to move into the home.”

3. Real estate investing creates passive income. Beyond just having someone else cover the expense of your monthly payments, renting out a property means that you can rely on your investment to generate passive income, as well. 

4. Short-term rentals are popular right now. Even if you aren’t interested in being a long-term landlord, short-term rentals are in high demand right now. Airbnb and VRBO have opened up numerous options for investors. Your investment property also doesn’t need to be local. You can purchase a rental property in a tourist “hot spot” and have someone else manage it for you. 

5. You can turn the investment into your primary residence later on. If you ever tire of renting your property out, or if you’re simply ready to become a homeowner, yourself, there is always the option for you to move into the home. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

The temperature is dropping, leaves are changing color, and pumpkin spice is everywhere you look. With fall color and produce back in season, you might be tempted to load up your house with both. However, if you plan to sell your home this fall, you might want to exercise some restraint. In the eyes of buyers, less is more. Here are four tips to consider: 

1. Pay attention to your fall-themed curb appeal. While too many fall decorations can distract attention away from your home’s best features, a few tasteful accents can produce an inviting atmosphere. Take the time to rake and round up fallen leaves and do general yard care. Buyers may give you a pass if they see your lawn is blanketed with leaves, but that doesn’t mean your home will make a good impression. 

“While too many fall decorations can distract attention away from your home’s best features, a few tasteful accents can produce an inviting atmosphere.”

2. Go easy on the gory Halloween decorations. Decorating your home with fake blood, guts, and skeletons might just be part of getting into the holiday spirit for you, but you never know what kind of reaction you’ll get from buyers. Some may be amused, but some may be frightened, and anything that has the potential to turn off a buyer is a no-no when listing your home. Play it safe with your decor choices, so you can appeal to the masses. 

3. Let in the light. It’s always a good idea to pull back the curtains and allow natural light to help you showcase your home. With shorter days in the fall and winter, you want to make sure you maximize the amount of light flooding into your home. This way, your home will appear larger. 

4. Make the space inviting. As the weather cools off, a warm and cozy atmosphere will give buyers a warm and cozy feeling. Place plush throws on your couch and beds and add fall-accented pillows to your couch and chairs as well.

        <description>

The other day, I was speaking with a friend of mine about their yard and gave them some advice about what they can do to make sure it stays in tip-top shape through the fall and winter as they prepare for a possible spring sale. Here are eight helpful tips that you can use to keep your yard in good shape:

1.  Fertilization and weed control. This helps reduce the stress your lawn will endure over the summer, and weed control will take care of those fall weeds as well. 

2. Aerate your yard. It should be overseeded as well. Aeration prepares it for winter and promotes healthy growth for spring. Overseeding helps fill in any bare spots and helps your lawn recover from the summer.

3. Rake and pick up leaves. This will reduce possible insect and disease damage over the winter. It’s also a good time to remove any dead or unsafe branches in your yard.

“Roots have a better chance to establish in the fall.”

4. The final mow of the season. Set your mower to the lowest height recommended for your grass on the last mow of the year to reduce the ability of diseases to affect them in the winter.

5. Plant trees and shrubs. In the fall, it gives roots a chance to establish in a lower-stress, moist environment.

6. Cut back and divide perennials. This will result in a more established plant next spring.

7. Add some fall color. Hearty mums are a great choice.

8. Plant spring bulbs. To ensure vibrant, early spring color in your landscaping, be sure to plant your bulbs in the fall.

If you have any questions for me about these tips or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

To be honest, purchasing new construction isn’t all that different from purchasing an existing home in an established neighborhood. Of course, for either purchase, there’s a lot of value that having the support of a professional agent can bring you when making such an important (and expensive) decision.

If you visited a model home on the weekend and talked to the on-site sales agent, you likely wouldn’t be talking to an agent who had your best interests at heart. What I mean by that is that particular agent is likely employed by or represents the builder and their fiduciary responsibility is to them.

When you hire an agent of your own, you get the advocacy of someone who does have your best interests at heart and who will help you navigate the intricacies of negotiation, paperwork, terms, conditions, and every other aspect of the real estate process in order to ensure that you’re getting the best benefits from your purchase.

For example, builders may offer discounts, savings, or incentives if you work with their lender or select specific upgrades and finishes; as agents in your corner, we’ll make sure that those incentives truly are savings and won’t come back to bite you later on.

“As agents in your corner, we’ll make sure that the builder’s incentives truly are savings and won’t come back to bite you later on.”

Something else to take into consideration is how long you plan to live in the home. If, for whatever reason, this home ends up not being your forever home and you decide to resell it later on, your agent can also advise you on which upgrades you can do to increase your future resale value and which ones may actually decrease or not improve that value.

One of the biggest things an agent on your side can help you with is researching the builder: how they work, the quality of their products, their building programs, the incentives they offer, and their sales history.

And finally, it typically doesn’t cost you any extra money to hire an agent like myself to represent you. Like any seller in a real estate transaction, the builder will be the one who ends up paying for your agent’s commission. If you’re not working with an agent, don’t assume they will just pass that difference on to you as cost savings, often they may use that money instead for marketing or just for profit. I’ve found that most of the builders in our market are “agent-friendly” and like working with buyers that have representation; the key thing is that we, the agents, need to be the ones who introduce you to the builder, not the other way around. If you have more questions on that, send me a message and we can talk more.

If you see value in having an agent like myself represent you in the purchase of a new construction property, and are looking to buy a brand-new home, reach out to us. We’d love to have your back in the transaction.

        <description>

There’s a common misconception among sellers (and even some real estate agents) that all it takes to sell a home is to stick a sign in the yard and wait for the offers to roll in. However, this couldn’t be further from the truth. Many sellers who attempt this route end up with expired listings.

So what do you do after this has happened to you? What does it take to make your second attempt at listing successful?

First, it’s important to realize that you’re not alone. Year to Date in Dane County, 10.68% of single-family home listings and 6.46% of all condo listings expired. 

But why?

There are actually a number of factors that can contribute to a listing’s success (or its failure). Chief among these factors are price, condition, and location, but also marketing. The marketing an agent uses to advertise a home can make or break its ability to sell. 

“Your agent needs to actively seek out buyers, rather than waiting for buyers to come to them.”

An effective marketing plan must include professional photography (and videography), an enticing description on its online listing, and adequate exposure. Your agent should use every available method to reach buyers, including social media advertising, print advertising, open houses, among other things. 

Proactive prospecting, in particular, is critical. In other words, your agent needs to actively seek out buyers, rather than waiting for buyers to come to them. 

If the agent you’re working with can’t do these things for you and your home, then it’s time to seek out a more experienced, knowledgeable professional. Our team would be happy to fill that role for you. So, if you or someone you know is looking to sell, please reach out to us. We can help you sell quickly and for top dollar, within a time frame that works for you. 

As always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

Just the other day, a renter I know who’s never been a homeowner asked me an interesting question: Is homeownership still one of the greatest ways to secure one’s financial future? The answer is a resounding yes. 

When you’re stepping into the market to buy a home for the first time, it’s easy to fix your attention on price and what your monthly mortgage payment will be, and understandably so. 

Up to this point, you’ve known exactly how much you were going to pay in rent each month, and now you’re trying to figure out how much house you can afford given your monthly budget.

Beyond price and your monthly payment, it’s also important to think about the home’s future value, or appreciation, over the life of your mortgage. When you sell your home, the majority of your profits will come from the equity you’ve gained between the time you bought the home and the years you’ve lived in the home. 

Although the market ebbs and flows and home values can ebb and flow with it, the value of real estate is always increasing, and there’s no real indication that will change anytime soon.

“The sooner you start paying off your mortgage, the better your financial circumstances will be later in life.”

Another advantage of becoming a homeowner early in life is that, more than likely, you’ll be able to pay off your mortgage during your working years. When you enter into retirement on a fixed income, having to continue paying on a mortgage can interfere with your ability to maintain your desired lifestyle. The sooner you start paying off your mortgage, the better your financial circumstances will be later in life.

Finally, for those who struggle to save money, owning a home is a means by which you can achieve this. Think of it as a kind of forced savings. As a homeowner, you’ll be forced to put away enough money to stay on top of your mortgage, cover your monthly expenses, and so on. All the while, your home’s value will grow, and that equity will pay dividends when you sell it down the line. 

If you have any questions about our local market or real estate in general or if there’s a topic you’d like me to cover in a future video, reach out to me by phone at 608-345-6594 or you can email me at JDHolt@KW.com. I look forward to hearing from you!

What’s the latest news on our Dane County market and beyond?  

Much like the last few months and years, we’re seeing a scarcity of inventory in certain segments of our market. Conditions continue to bode well for sellers, but we’re also seeing some changes that may signal greater opportunities for buyers. 

Recently, Dane County has seen an uptick in the number of homes on the market, both in terms of single-family homes and condos: 1,000 single-family properties and 225 condos are currently listed. 

Another recent development is homes are spending more time on the market. For single-family homes, the average days on market is 67 days, and the average condo is sitting on the market for a little over 120 days.  

I’m constantly being asked about inventory and justifiably so. The amount of inventory we have is a prime indicator of whether we’re in a seller’s market, a buyer’s market, or a balanced market. We’re firmly in a seller’s market at the moment, and though our inventory situation is showing modest signs of going the opposite direction or toward a balanced state, we’re still nowhere near where we’d like to be.  

In the up-to-$200,000 price point, we have just 0.85 months’ worth of inventory, which means homes priced around there are flying off the market. When we move up to the $200,000 to $350,000 range, inventory is slightly higher with 1.4 months’ worth. Inventory doubles in the $350,000 to $500,000 range, and rises still in the luxury market to 5.3 months’ worth. 

“Conditions continue to bode well for sellers, but we’re also seeing some changes that may signal greater opportunities for buyers.”

As for median sales price, single-family homes are selling for $319,000 right now. Contrast that with the median price for these homes in the spring, which was $300,000. The median sale price for condos has slightly increased to $200,000. 

Now, I know not everyone lives in or is focused on the numbers for Dane County, so let’s quickly run through the numbers for the larger South Central Wisconsin region:


  Regional inventory is at 2.8 months’ worth
  Regional median sales price for single-family homes has fallen a bit to $232,000
  Regional median sales price for condos is at about $190,000 


Lastly and surprisingly, our interest rates are still unbelievably low: They’re currently sub-4% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Even as home prices increase, it’s still a great time to get into a new home and secure an interest rate in the low-4% range.   

If you’re a seller who’s looking to move up, our current market is rife with opportunities to do so. You’ll find that conditions are favorable to sell your home, and the availability of homes provides more flexibility for you as a buyer as well. 

If you have any questions about the area’s real estate market or if there’s a topic you’d like me to feature on a future video, reach out to me by phone at 608-345-6594 or by email at JDHolt@KW.com. I look forward to hearing from you!

        <description>

If you currently own a home and are thinking of selling it and buying a new one, you might be daunted by the process of juggling both transactions. Luckily, I’m here to give you a few tips on how to navigate the process.

First, talk to your lender. Before you even begin to look at homes, you should make sure that all of your finances are in order. You’ll want to ensure that nothing has changed in your financial picture that you’re not aware of and to figure out your options. 

“Before you even begin to look at homes, you should make sure that all of your finances are in order.”

There are three ways to go about handling both these transactions at once:

1. Sell your current home first. To do this, you’ll need to list your home on the market at an appropriate price that you know will help it sell quickly. This can be an advantageous way to go about it, since a lot of sellers will be hesitant to accept an offer that’s contingent on you selling your current home.

Once you close on the sale of your current home, you could potentially do a rent-back agreement, in which the purchasers of your home agree to let you live there for a predetermined period of time for rent. This would allow you time to find and purchase a new home to move into.

2. Buy your new home first. In this situation, you might be saddled with two concurrent mortgages, so it may not be ideal, depending on your financial situation.

3. Buy and sell in the same day. It might be tricky, but it is possible to plan things in such a way that you can close on the sale of your current home and the purchase of your new home in the same day. Of course, this doesn’t give you much time to move, so you may have to plan ahead.

        <description>

When you’re a home seller looking to create the best first impression on potential buyers, there are a number of different strategies to follow:

1. Start by improving the curb appeal. Start from the street and work your way in. This includes looking at things like your driveway, the exterior landscaping, and the exterior of the home in general. Look at the outside of the property from a buyer’s perspective to make sure that it looks the best it possibly can. This way, when potential buyers drive or walk by the home, they’ll get the impression your home is well-maintained.

2. Have a clean entryway. Make sure that your doormat is clean, your front door is freshly painted and presentable, and that your doorbell is in working order. The color of your door should complement your home, and if possible, the neighborhood at large.

3. Eliminate any odors. You don’t want potential buyers to walk into your home, only to be smacked in the face by the odor of pets, cigarette smoke, and even chemical smells—be careful to limit your use of deodorizers and fragrances, which can turn off potential buyers. The key when it comes to scent is balance.

“Be careful to limit your use of deodorizers and fragrances, which can turn off potential buyers.”

4. Deep clean the house. If you really want to create a great first impression, you’ll need to take the time to deep clean your entire home, meaning you should clean the carpets, floors, and all other surfaces. And don’t forget to dust! You don’t want to give buyers the impression that you’re not maintaining your home as well as you could be. They may wonder if there are other areas you’re neglecting when it comes to home care.

5. Declutter your home. You don’t want to have various piles of your possessions lying around the home, especially if they take up floor space. Be sure to clean out and organize your storage areas, like your closets and cabinets. This is a good time to go through your things and purge those items you no longer need, want, or use. This will make your home seem neater and more accessible to a buyer.

6. Repaint. Now, I don’t mean that you need to repaint the entire exterior or interior of your home, although there are studies that show you can recoup one-and-a-half to two times your investment in your resale price if you do. What I’m focusing on here, though, is making sure that you’ve touched up any nicks, dings, or chips in your paint. Be sure to use a neutral color palette if you want to appeal to the widest pool of buyers!

If you’re thinking about selling your home in today’s market and you have any questions about what you can do to sell quickly and for top dollar, feel free to reach out to me. I’m always here to help.

        <description>

Downsizing is the process of moving from a larger home to a smaller one. Why might people do this? As it turns out, there are many reasons:

Most often, people downsize when there has been a life-changing occurrence, such as when the kids graduate and move away, or maybe you’re on the verge of retirement. 

It could also be that you just realize that managing a home of a certain size is more work, stress, and money than you can handle, and so a smaller home simply seems more feasible for you. This is especially true for elderly homeowners, and even for those who lead lifestyles that are simply too busy to allow them to juggle home maintenance with their lives.

“If you’re on a larger lot that requires continuous landscaping and maintenance, perhaps that means it’s time to look for something a little more manageable.”

Especially for those whose kids have moved away from home, another reason to downsize is the realization that you just have too much space that you don’t use. That goes for the outside, as well; if you’re on a larger lot that requires continuous landscaping and maintenance, perhaps that means it’s time to look for something a little more manageable. 

Lastly, there are financial benefits to downsizing your home. If you’ve lived in your home for a long time, you’ve probably built up a fair amount of equity. Now could be the most opportune time to put your home on the market and make the move using the money you have tied up in the home.

If you have any questions or comments about downsizing, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.

        <title>Selling on Your Own vs. Hiring a Real Estate Professional</title>

        <guid>https://s3.amazonaws.com/vyralmarketing/Josh+Holt/Videos/2019/May/Madison%2C+WI+Real+Estate+Agent-+Selling+On+Your+Own+vs.+Hiring+a+Real+Estate+Professional.mp4</guid>
        <description>

When you’re weighing the decision to hire a real estate professional to help you sell your home versus just doing it by yourself, there are four key points to keep in mind that will help you make your final decision about which route to go:

1. Contracts and paperwork. Regardless of who’s doing the selling, you’re still entering into a legally binding contract with the other party when you do sell it. If you’re not using a real estate professional to help you, you’ll want to have a real estate attorney review the contracts for you so that you can be sure that your transaction is legally compliant.

2. Marketing your home. The goal of most sellers is to get their listing in front of as many qualified buyers’ eyes as possible. In this day and age, you can do a lot on your own to give your listing exposure, particularly with social media. However, did you know that there are literally thousands of websites out there that real estate professionals post your listings to if you work with them? Chances are you don’t have the time or resources to post to that many sites!

“Selling a home is about more than just the dollars and cents—you also need to think about the amount of time you have to dedicate to the logistics.”

3. Pricing your home accurately. The reality is that you only have one shot to make a great initial impression. If you price your home too high when you first put it on the market, it will probably sit stagnant on the market, causing people to wonder what’s wrong with it. It’s a surefire way to reduce the amount of activity your home will see. The same is true if you price it too low. Many people like to go online to check home values, but there’s really no better way to get the true value of your home than to talk to a real estate professional (like myself). We can do a comparative market analysis (CMA) to help you discern what people would be willing to pay for your home.

4. The value of your time. A lot of folks don’t always think of how much time it takes to sell a home. Regardless of whether you sell yours on your own or if you hire an agent, there are things you’ll need to do in order to make sure the sale goes your way, like getting the property in show-ready condition. When you work with a real estate professional, they’ll handle all the particulars of the transaction for you, like scheduling showings and negotiating with the buyers and their agents. You likely have your own career to deal with, and you probably won’t be available when a buyer wants to see your home. Further still, we vet your buyers to make sure they’re qualified to actually be able to purchase the home. Selling a home is about more than just the dollars and cents—you also need to think about the amount of time you have to dedicate to the logistics.

If you have any questions about today’s topic or if you’re in need of a real estate professional to help you with your own home sale, feel free to give me a call or send an email. I’d be glad to hear from you.

These four tips will aid you in better navigating the current real estate market as a homebuyer:

1. Consider submitting a larger earnest money deposit with your offer. There might not be an industry standard for this, but the earnest money is a good faith deposit that accompanies your offer and will speak volumes about your enthusiasm and seriousness about buying the property. By putting in a few thousand dollars extra, then, you’ll let the seller know that you’re a strong and serious buyer. 

2. Show the sellers that you are qualified to purchase their home. Probably most important of all, you need to show that you’ve taken the steps to meet with a lender and not only get pre-qualified, but pre-approved as well. A pre-approval, again, solidly demonstrates that you’re a serious and able buyer.  

“Put your best foot forward when making your offer to the extent that you’re comfortable.”

3. Give the sellers time to move and find out what terms are important to them. With good communication, your agent can help you with this. Whether the seller wants to have an expedient close and move-out or they need extra time, it’ll look good if you can accommodate the timetable that works best for them. 

4. Write your best offer! In this moment’s market, it won’t serve you well to write a lowball offer in the hopes that you’ll negotiate higher. Instead of counting on the seller’s willingness to negotiate and counter back, put your best foot forward when making your offer to the extent that you’re comfortable. In other words, decide how high you’re willing to go, so that if the home sold for more than that, you’d be comfortable walking away. Most sellers won’t have the appetite to go back and forth if another buyer sets themselves apart by making their best offer from the outset.

There’s not really a one-size-fits-all answer to the question, “How is the market?” It depends on whether you’re looking to buy or sell, what your price point is, where you’re looking to live, and much more. These factors all play a part, so let’s see what the latest numbers have to say for each.

In the Greater Dane County area, we’re expecting home prices to increase. Right now, the median price of a single-family home is $300,000, and condos are around $195,000.

Inventory is illustrated in terms of how many months it would take for all currently listed homes to sell. Six months of inventory is a balanced market; anything above that is a buyer’s market, and anything below is a seller’s market. 

“Ultimately, it’s still a great market for buyers and sellers alike.”

As of now, we have an average of 1.5 months’ worth of inventory. Homes in the $200,000 price range only have two weeks of inventory. The $200,000 to $350,000 range has one month of inventory. At $350,000 to $500,000, there are 2.5 months of inventory—things tend to soften as price points increase. Over $500,000, there are 4.5 months of inventory.

There are about 800 single-family homes currently on the market. On average, they take 87 days to sell. Interest rates are in the low 4% range for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, so ultimately, it’s still a great market for buyers and sellers alike.

Making the most out of our market, however, depends on who you have working as your real estate professional. I’d be more than happy to help you find a great deal on the perfect home or make a sale for top dollar. If you have any questions or need more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
