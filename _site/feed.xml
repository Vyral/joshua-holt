        <title>5 Seller Setbacks to Avoid</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p1VIDYvOmas?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been working a lot with first-time homeowners who are now looking to become first-time home sellers. As such, I wanted to share some common seller setbacks I’ve seen and how you can best prepare for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think back to the purchase of your current home, you’ll likely remember that there were several things that sent you into a panic but which turned out to be totally normal parts of the process. In hindsight, you may even laugh at how you thought something like that scary inspection report would prove to be a colossal setback. Nevertheless, knowledge is power, so here is what you’ll want to know about the selling process: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Leave emotions out of the transaction.&lt;/strong&gt; As a home seller, you’ll likely experience surprisingly strong feelings about your home. Emotions may make you feel better in the short term, but feelings won’t last; always think about the big picture and your personal goals before changing course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make sure your home is impeccable, even before staging.&lt;/strong&gt; You may feel very confident in your taste and decor, but it’s important to remember that anything that fills your home is a potential distraction for buyers. It’s nothing personal, though it may feel that way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Consider a pre-inspection before you list.&lt;/strong&gt; A pre-listing inspection will turn up things you should definitely repair, potential problems you might not even know exist, and provide clear answers on the exact condition of your home. If you’re concerned about cost, I’ll advise you on the changes that are worth the money and the things that are likely okay to leave as is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Handling lowball offers well.&lt;/strong&gt; Though we’re not seeing many of these in the market of the moment, they do still occur, so it’s good to be aware of them. There’s a difference between an offer that’s slightly below asking price and one that’s tens of thousands of dollars below it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowball offers can be a form of real-time feedback about your home; if a range of buyers submit low offers, it may point to a clear issue that you’ve overlooked, and therefore it forces an opportunity to address that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Understand that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;everything &lt;/em&gt;is negotiable.&lt;/strong&gt; Buyers may want all sorts of concessions and contingencies. It might be helpful to think of your home sale as another ordinary transaction, like buying a car. Negotiation in a car sale is a no brainer, so transfer that mentality to your home sale. Just as an auto dealer wouldn’t accept any ol’ offer, you don’t have to give in on every ask, either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selling your home for the first time is an opportunity to learn about real estate. The more you know before you sell, the bigger the advantage you’ll have in the end; you’ll be calm, focused, and determined when it comes to decisions that benefit your sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have questions on this or any other topic, please feel free to reach out via phone or email. I’m always here to be a resource for you, so let me know how I can be of assistance!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Evolution of Home Buying</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zN6iigV6FdI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way we work has always influenced where we live and what type of home we buy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the past year, 25% of the workforce worked from home at least part of the time. Based on the world we live in, that statistic will likely only increase. Due to remote work, we’re spending more time at home than ever before, and this is changing the criteria we use when shopping for a home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, remote work is changing the way people buy homes in three important ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. It’s expanding the geography of the home search.&lt;/strong&gt; Since they’re not tied to a specific commute time to the office, buyers are looking further away from city centers to find their home. They’re also prioritizing lower taxes and school districts over distance from work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Due to remote work, we’re spending more time at home than ever before, and this is changing the criteria we use when shopping for a home.%20http://localhost:4000/the-evolution-of-home-buying.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Due to remote work, we’re spending more time at home than ever before, and this is changing the criteria we use when shopping for a home.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. It’s causing more buyers to look for dedicated office space.&lt;/strong&gt; For many years, buyers’ focus centered on open concept floor plans, and many still prefer this type of floor plan. However, more and more are looking for a dedicated, private space they can make into an office. Perhaps it’s an actual office space, an additional bedroom, or extra space in the basement or attic that they can convert. Conversely, they’re no longer prioritizing things like home gyms and theaters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. It’s causing more buyers to settle down for the long haul.&lt;/strong&gt; Back in the 1980s, people moved and sold their homes every five or six years. Now that average has increased to nine to 12 years. It’s more important for modern buyers to get the space they need right now instead of moving later on to get that space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, it’s likely that companies will continue to offer flexible working arrangements, thereby giving greater freedom to prospective buyers. Sellers who modify their listing by adding a private home office may find themselves at a great advantage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Post-Coronavirus Moving Trends</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5G2rgVibc64?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus pandemic is sure to have long-reaching consequences in all walks of life, but some of these consequences might surprise you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;strong&gt;the pandemic might completely overturn recent trends regarding where people choose to live.&lt;/strong&gt; Over the last three decades, people have increasingly preferred cities over suburbs. Recent studies show that each new generation of young people has been more and more likely to move to cities, and many opt to stay in those cities even after getting married and starting a family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-coronavirus, this may well change. The most obvious reason is health. Urban areas are more crowded and involve more human interaction, which means greater exposure to potential viruses. Also, shelter-in-place orders are harder to bear in an urban environment. By comparison, a house in the suburbs can offer more space, a backyard, and easier access to areas where you can exercise and spend time safely outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Demand is rising, with Zillow and Realtor.com both reporting increased search traffic and buyer inquiries.%20http://localhost:4000/post-coronavirus-moving-trends.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Demand is rising, with Zillow and Realtor.com both reporting increased search traffic and buyer inquiries.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, workplaces are changing. Many people will continue to work from home after the pandemic subsides. Along with falling gas prices, this makes long commutes a smaller issue than it had been in the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent Harris Poll showed that 46% of city-dwellers are considering a move, compared to just 26% of suburban residents and 21% of rural residents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While home sales nearly came to a halt at the end of March, that’s now changing.&lt;/strong&gt; Demand is rising, with Zillow and Realtor.com both reporting increased search traffic and buyer inquiries. In the Madison area, I can certainly vouch for an increase in activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, this situation changes daily, but I stay on top of the local Madison area market. Whether you’re thinking of buying, selling, or just need some advice, give me a call or shoot me an email and I’d be happy to guide you. I hope you and your family stay safe and healthy. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Tips for a Safe Move During This Time</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J5O-EEHTtbs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, several folks have asked me about how they can keep their families safe during the moving process right now. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, I have three tips for you to help make your move safe and healthy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. It’s worth spending a bit of extra money.&lt;/strong&gt; The American Moving and Storage Association recommends passing on free, recycled boxes from supermarkets and liquor stores. Instead, get new moving boxes and packing tape. The reason is simple: Less chance of exposure to the virus. Stock up on adequate disinfectants and wipes for yourself, your moving truck, and any shared equipment you might be using.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can afford it and it makes sense for your situation, hire a company that will handle the move for you safely and strategically. Many moving companies currently provide virtual estimates and contactless moving, which reduces risk significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Disinfect high-contact points such as doorknobs and countertops.%20http://localhost:4000/3-tips-for-a-safe-move-during-this-time.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Disinfect high-contact points such as doorknobs and countertops.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Preparation is more important than ever.&lt;/strong&gt; A move often becomes a messy and disorganized affair. Now is the time to make it as neat as possible. Pack up everything and prepare it in advance of the actual move. By minimizing moving time, you’re minimizing contact and exposure. If you’re doing the move yourself, make sure to clean the truck and any shared moving bins or boxes. If you’re hiring a moving company, then spend the time to vet them. You’ll want to know what specific measures they’re using to deal with the pandemic—both with their equipment and their employees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Respect the threat.&lt;/strong&gt; A move can be a frustrating experience. However, this is no time to throw caution to the wind and get careless. That means ongoing advice about social distancing, gloves, masks, and hygiene still applies. For example, if you are working with a moving company, make sure they have access to a sink with soap or hand sanitizer. Additionally, make sure to disinfect high-contact points such as doorknobs and countertops once the move is complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving isn’t always the most pleasant experience and this pandemic situation certainly doesn’t help, but it is possible to move safely in today’s market. If you have any questions about your move or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Our Economy After COVID-19</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_dOEpebjcc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The human toll of the coronavirus pandemic may forever change families, yet the economic impact will rebound with a cycle of downturn followed by economic expansion, as we’ve seen play out in the U.S. economy many times before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’d like to share what leading experts and current research indicate about the economic impact we’ll likely see as a result of COVID-19. Let’s start with a forecast of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When looking at GDP (the measure of our country’s economic health), a survey of three leading financial institutions projects a sharp decline followed by a steep rebound in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study from John Burns Consulting notes that past pandemics have created V-shaped economic recoveries, and had minimal impact on housing prices.&lt;/strong&gt; This certainly gives us hope and optimism regarding what is to come as this crisis passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=This won’t last forever, and we will get back to growth mode—we’ve got this.%20http://localhost:4000/our-economy-after-covid-19.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“This won’t last forever, and we will get back to growth mode—we’ve got this.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this historical analysis in mind, many business owners are also optimistically anticipating a bright economic return. A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers survey captures this confidence, &lt;strong&gt;noting 66% of surveyed business owners believe their companies will return to normal business rhythms within a month of the pandemic passing&lt;/strong&gt;, and 90% feel they should be back to normal operation one to three months afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From expert financial institutions to business leaders across the country, we can clearly see that a quick return to normal once the current crisis subsides is not too far away. In essence, this pandemic won’t last forever, and we will get back to growth mode—we’ve got this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lives and businesses are being impacted by COVID-19, but &lt;strong&gt;experts do see a light at the end of the tunnel.&lt;/strong&gt; As the economy slows down due to the health crisis, we can take the guidance and advice from experts that this too will pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about real estate, please feel free to reach out via phone or email. We would love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>5 Sweet Tax Deductions When Selling a Home</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SgcVgxN1YfQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering if there are tax deductions you can take when selling a home. The answer is: You bet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, you may remember that 2018’s new tax code—aka the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—changed some rules for homeowners. Rest assured that if you sold your home last year (or are planning to in the future), your tax deductions when you file with the IRS can still amount to sizable savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five different tax deductions you can take as a home seller:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Selling costs.&lt;/strong&gt; These deductions are allowed as long as they are directly tied to the sale of the home and you lived in the home for at least two out of the five years preceding the sale. Another caveat: The home must be a principal residence and not an investment property. These costs can include legal fees, title fees, advertising costs, commissions, and perhaps even staging costs. Just remember that you can’t deduct these costs in the same way as, say, mortgage interest. Instead, you subtract them from the sale price of your home, which in turn positively affects your capital gains tax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I recommend consulting with your tax advisor for further clarification.%20http://localhost:4000/5-sweet-tax-deductions-when-selling-a-home.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“I recommend consulting with your tax advisor for further clarification.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Home improvements and repairs.&lt;/strong&gt; If you renovated a few rooms to make your home more marketable (so you could fetch a higher sale price), you can deduct those upgrade costs as well. This includes painting the house or repairing the roof or water heater. There’s a catch, and it all boils down to timing: You can deduct those expenses as selling costs as long as they were made within 90 days of the closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Property taxes.&lt;/strong&gt; This deduction is capped at $10,000. So, if you were dutifully paying your property taxes up to the point when you sold your home, you can deduct the amount you paid in property taxes this year up to $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Mortgage interest.&lt;/strong&gt; As with property taxes, you can deduct the interest on your mortgage for the portion of the year you owned your home. Just remember that under the 2018 tax code, new homeowners (and home sellers) can deduct the interest on up to only $750,000 of mortgage debt. That is, unless you obtained your mortgage prior to December 15, 2017. If you did, you can deduct up to $1,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the mortgage interest and property taxes are itemized deductions. This means that, in order for it to work in your favor, all of your itemized deductions need to be greater than the new standard deduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Capital gains tax for sellers.&lt;/strong&gt; The rule isn’t technically a deduction (it’s an exclusion), but you’re still going to like it. As a reminder, capital gains are your profits from selling your home—whatever cash is left after paying off your expenses, plus any outstanding mortgage debt. These profits are taxed as income, but here’s the good news: You can exclude up to $250,000 of the capital gains from the sale if you’re single, and $500,000 if married. The only big catch is that you must have lived in your home at least two of the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want further clarification on these five sweet tax deductions, I recommend you consult with your tax advisor. If you have any real estate-related questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I’d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What the Coronavirus Means for Our Real Estate Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uTJ8S-vgDJ0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you’re aware, there’s been a lot of talk in the news lately about the coronavirus, and many people have reached out to me wondering how this will impact our real estate market.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we try to predict what will happen in our local market, whether it’s due to the coronavirus or any other factor, &lt;strong&gt;we look to what’s happening on our nation’s coasts,&lt;/strong&gt; meaning markets like Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco. These are good leading indicators of trends that will eventually impact our market. When we see a shift in the luxury markets out on the coast, that’s something we’ll probably see in South Central Wisconsin sooner rather than later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If your home is valued above that or the $500,000 mark, I recommend listing it sooner rather than later.%20http://localhost:4000/what-the-coronavirus-means-for-our-real-estate-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If your home is valued above that or the $500,000 mark, I recommend listing it sooner rather than later.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re buying or selling, if you’re concerned about the coronavirus’ impact on our market, &lt;strong&gt;my first piece of advice is to reach out to me.&lt;/strong&gt; We can talk about your goals and formulate a strategy to accomplish them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a seller, one thing we do know is that the median home price in Dane County is $285,000, so if your home is valued above that or the $500,000 mark, I recommend listing it sooner rather than later. We still have limited inventory and there are plenty of buyers, so strike while the iron is hot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, because of the volatility we’re seeing in the stock market due to the coronavirus, mortgage rates remain lower than last year. This is making the biggest impact below the $285,000 price point. Inventory is already tight in this market, and low interest rates will bring out more buyers and increase competition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we don’t want to see happen is sellers thinking now is a great time to raise prices, because that might not play out how you imagine it. Like I said, I recommend first giving me a call so we can find out what your home is worth, make a plan, and capture the attention of all the buyers out there taking advantage of these low interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, we’ll keep an eye on this situation. If you have any questions about this topic at all, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’m here to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What’s Happening in Our Market</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ndvH2XfDqL8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Long of Guild Mortgage joins me today to dispel some common market misconceptions and share his perspective from the lending side of things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s going to happen with the market in 2020 and beyond? Many homeowners remember losing value in their homes from 2008 to 2012, but since 2013 home values have been recovering. Since homes have been appreciating for so long, many believe it’s time for a market correction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand that &lt;strong&gt;the market fundamentals we have now are different than the ones we had back then.&lt;/strong&gt; Just because the market’s been appreciating for a while doesn’t mean there’s something wrong or properties will start losing value. From 2005 to 2008, we saw rapid appreciation that was unsustainable—prices rose as high as 10% per year. Historically, home values in Dane County appreciate 3% to 4% per year. &lt;em&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; sustainable, so if homes keep appreciating at that rate, they’ll outpace inflation and, theoretically, never cool down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=If you bought a home and something were to go wrong, you’d be fine long-term.%20http://localhost:4000/whats-happening-in-our-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“If you bought a home and something were to go wrong, you’d be fine long-term.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2013, the pace of home value recovery increased rapidly, but now it’s slowing and we’re settling into a nice, pillowy landing. Last year, home values statewide rose about 5%, and this year they’re predicted to rise between 3% and 4%. &lt;strong&gt;Some might see this slowdown as a bad thing, but this return to normalcy is a good thing.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the average prediction of where the market’s headed in the next five years, if you purchased a $250,000 house now, it would appreciate by $47,500 by January 2025—a nice, slow pace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a place to live no matter what, and you can either pay your landlord’s rent or your mortgage. Only one of you is getting that appreciation, so you might as well take advantage of that equity. Many people lost a lot of money during the previous recession, but the No. 1 reason people buy houses isn’t that it’s a financial investment but because they want to control where they live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who lost value starting in 2008 got it all back by 2017. If you bought a home and something were to go wrong, you’d be fine long-term. You’ll still pay off your mortgage and come out with a lot of equity. If nothing goes wrong, you’ll come out &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any lending questions, feel free to give Joe a call at (608) 729-5379 or email him at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jlong@guildmortgage.net&quot;&gt;jlong@guildmortgage.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have any other questions about the real estate market, don’t hesitate to call or email me anytime. I’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMfMPJiOka8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to go to our state capitol building for the annual Realtor® and Government Day. Today, I’m sharing my experience by recapping the three main topics discussed at the event, as well as sharing my insight on these matters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to skip to topics that interest you most: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:29 - The issue of riparian water rights (2018 supreme court case regarding homeowners’ right to build a pier)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:33 - Legislation in the works prohibiting the habit of “chasing sales” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:45 - The lack of workforce housing in our area and proposed remedies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 6:20 - Wrapping things up &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in discussing these important topics in more detail, please feel free to reach out by phone or email. I’d love the opportunity to inform the homeowners in our great state and gain different perspectives on these issues. &lt;/p&gt;
