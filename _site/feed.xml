        <title>How We’re Giving Back to Families in 2022</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/X3mXBGrLiW0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Here’s why we’re partnering with the Respite Center at RISE Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team recently had the opportunity to tour the Respite Center at RISE Wisconsin. We learned all about the work they’re doing to provide emotional support and emergency care for local families in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really resonated with us. We work with families every day with the focus of changing their lives through homeownership. Through our work, we’ve found that many families out there can benefit from organizations like RISE Wisconsin and their Respite Center. &lt;strong&gt;We’re proud to announce that we have partnered with RISE Wisconsin to make their Respite Center in Madison our official nonprofit for 2022.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This center provides emergency childcare and respite for children ages zero to 14 as well as parents support and crisis counseling seven days a week. This center also helps parents and caregivers access important resources to support and stabilize their families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Helping families in need directly aligns with our core values.%20http://localhost:4000/how-were-giving-back-to-families-in-2022.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Helping families in need directly aligns with our core values.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to partner with an organization that is making a great local impact but might not be getting much shine. Helping families in need and providing emotional support and care for the youth in our area directly aligns with our core values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every time someone buys, sells, or invests in real estate with our team, we will give a portion of our profits to the Respite Center.&lt;/strong&gt; Our goal is not only to raise awareness for this great organization, but we want to raise a total of $10,000 for the center in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the Respite Center, buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Will Home Prices Continue To Rise?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JwzS8cYuYc4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Here’s what you need to know about the future of home prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, a lot of people have asked us about home prices. Some people are wondering if they’ll continue to go up, and others want to know how much their home value has increased. Today we’ll talk about what’s going on with prices in Madison. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been paying attention to the market, you probably won’t be surprised to learn that home prices have increased by 18.1% over the last year. This seems pretty crazy, but when you look at the graph at 0:44 in the video, you can see that &lt;strong&gt;we’ve only been playing catch up.&lt;/strong&gt; Prices crashed during the 2008 crisis, and they’re only now starting to return to normal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=The factors that led to our crazy market will still be present in 2022.%20http://localhost:4000/will-home-prices-continue-to-rise.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“The factors that led to our crazy market will still be present in 2022.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like our accelerating home values peaked towards the end of 2021, but that does not mean they will decrease soon. It simply means the rate that values are increasing will slow down a little bit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look ahead to next year, all the factors that drive our market now will still be present. We continue to have extremely low inventory, and home values will likely increase. However, there are unknown factors that could affect our market, such as supply chain issues or new COVID variants. &lt;strong&gt;Prices will continue to rise, but at a more moderate, healthy pace. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about today’s video, please reach out to us via phone or email. We are always willing to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Happy Veterans Day</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/hB9nCZjwhGI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;As a Veteran-owned business, we want to give thanks to our Veterans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veterans Day is just a couple of days away, so I want to thank all our Veterans for their service and wish them a happy Veterans Day. &lt;strong&gt;As a Veteran-owned business, we take great pride in being able to help our fellow Veterans with all of their real estate needs&lt;/strong&gt;, whether that’s buying, selling, or investing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Community Champions Program is an additional incentive that we offer to Veterans who choose to buy, sell, or invest in real estate with us at the Holt Real Estate Team. If you’d like to learn additional information about that program, reach out to us, and we’ll gladly share more information with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t served but know a Veteran, please thank them for their service to our country and the lifestyle that we all get to enjoy. If you have any questions about the local real estate market, feel free to give us a call at 608 345-6594 or via email at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:JDHolt@kw.com&quot;&gt;JDHolt@kw.com&lt;/a&gt;. We look forward to hearing from you. Happy Veterans day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Tips for a Happy &amp; Safe Halloween</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAxd6P2csPU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a homeowner who expects trick-or-treaters to come to your door, here are a few safety tips to keep in mind this year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Keep your walkways and/or porch well-lit.&lt;/strong&gt; That way, kids and their parents can reach your door safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Keep your pets out of sight.&lt;/strong&gt; Pets can often get stressed out by seeing so many strangers come to the door. Put them in another room to reduce their stress and prevent them from scaring anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Park your cars in the garage, if possible.&lt;/strong&gt; That ensures your trick-or-treaters will have enough room to get to your front door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Use flameless LED candles in your jack-o’-lanterns instead of real candles.&lt;/strong&gt; This eliminates the fire hazard that burning candles presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Have a safe, fun, and happy Halloween!%20http://localhost:4000/tips-for-a-happy-safe-halloween.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Have a safe, fun, and happy Halloween!”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you’re planning to go out into the neighborhood and trick or treat, here are a few points to follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Stick to neighborhoods with sidewalks.&lt;/strong&gt; It usually gets dark around that time, so finding areas with sidewalks means that you won’t have to walk in the streets. It might be a good idea to put reflective tape on your kids’ jackets or costumes to make sure that cars can see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Keep to the crosswalks.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t just dart across the road to get to the next home; if you or your children are wearing dark costumes, it might be hard for oncoming cars to see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Carry a flashlight with you.&lt;/strong&gt; Some driveways might be long and dark, so having a flashlight can come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Remind your kids not to enter a stranger’s home.&lt;/strong&gt; Have them stay on the front porch and in full view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Be mindful of the treats your kids receive&lt;/strong&gt;. You never know—someone might put a food item in their bag that your kids are allergic to, or they might slip in something that isn’t necessarily appropriate. Comb through the candy before letting them eat it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you and yours have a safe, fun, and happy Halloween!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you feel like your home search is like hunting for a unicorn, give our team a call. We’ll be able to help you find the dream home you’re searching for at a great price.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Market Shift is Coming</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3ej-VtlPI8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The market is shifting from a seller’s market to a more balanced market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked whether we’re starting to see a shift from the robust seller’s market we’ve experienced to a balanced market. &lt;strong&gt;The market is beginning to change.&lt;/strong&gt; Price adjustments and longer days on market are signs that we’re shifting from a seller’s market to a more balanced market. That means the market will become less competitive for buyers, and there won’t be bidding wars on every home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=We're shifting from a seller's market to a more balanced market.%20http://localhost:4000/the-market-shift-is-coming.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“We’re shifting from a seller’s market to a more balanced market.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic began and interest rates plummeted, a lot of people decided they wanted to buy a home. Many of them were competing for specific areas. Now, people are starting to spread out, so demand won’t be so concentrated. Buyers should be able to make offers without waiving contingencies or using other strategies to stand out and there will be more options available. &lt;strong&gt;In today’s shifting market, buyers can now feel more confident that the home they want is the one they’ll be able to win. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been sitting on the sidelines for a while or you’ve felt burnt out by the current market, reach out to us and let us show you what’s really going on in our local market. We can set you up for success so that you can win your dream house. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bwouk3U9RIY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Today I’m talking with Joe Long from Guild Mortgage about some of the nuances to be aware of with the VA loan. He’s a great local lender, and he does a lot of business with Veterans as well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Introducing Savannah, Our Newest Team Member</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJxQkTiXOL0?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Here’s my conversation with Savannah, our team’s new executive assistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m joined by Savannah Paukner, a new executive assistant for our team. I want to take a second to introduce her because if you decide to buy or sell with our team, you’ll probably be working with Savannah a lot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Savannah, what was your background before real estate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before, my family and I were in Fort Leonard in Missouri while my husband finished his career in the Air Force. I was working for the government in the purchasing field, and before that, I worked in the county’s treasury department. I was doing back-end support work for the most part, so I have plenty of experience working with a lot of moving parts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=When I saw you had a job opening, I knew it was a great opportunity.%20http://localhost:4000/introducing-savannah-our-newest-team-member.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“When I saw you had a job opening, I knew it was a great opportunity.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know your family just moved to Wisconsin a few months ago, so what made you want to get into real estate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you already know, when my family moved to Wisconsin, we worked with your team to buy a home. Even long-distance, the experience was fantastic, so when I saw you had a job opening, I saw it as a sign of a great opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your role here, and how will you interact with our clients?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I’m taking all the back-end support off the agents’ plates. If there’s any paperwork, appointments, or correspondence between agents and clients, I’ll be the one making sure everything is in order. In other words, I’ll be making sure our team fulfills our promise to give our clients the best experience possible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re all thrilled here at the Holt Real Estate Team to have Savannah on our team, and we’re especially excited for our clients to work with her. All of us are dedicated to providing you with the best service possible, so if you are looking to buy or sell a home, please give us a call or send us an email. We would love to help.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Cost of Waiting To Buy</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fydz_dHw-l4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Waiting could cost you more in the long run than buying right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;House prices have been rising ever since 2013, and this past year, we saw incredible price appreciation. This also comes at a time when interest rates are extremely low. Today I’m joined by Joe Long of Guild Mortgage to discuss the cost of waiting for first-time homebuyers and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to browse specific topics at your leisure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0:18 — Introducing today’s topic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0:39 — Price appreciation since 2013&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:22 — Low interest rates and affordability&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:15 — The reality of waiting and saving money&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3:48 — PMI is not as expensive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:52 — How could home values drop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5:30 — Waiting is a losing strategy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6:11 — Wrapping up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out. I am always willing to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gaspero is joining our team as an agent, and we wanted to introduce him to all of you. Here’s a quick Q&amp;amp;A with him so you can get to know him better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your background from before you got into real estate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before real estate, I worked at Meredith Hospital. I was originally pursuing a career in healthcare administration and management, but I found my love for real estate and decided to give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What got you connected to Keller Williams?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a good friend, David Perry, who got me into real estate. He kept trying to push me and get me to join his team, but I had other career goals at the time. It sounded like something I wanted to do, but it just wasn’t the right time. By the time I finally got my real estate license, he had moved to Las Vegas, but he said to check out Keller Williams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What made you decide that joining our team was the right route to take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the support aspect of the team because I’d never done real estate before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you hoping to accomplish when working with a client?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to help them as best I can and provide the best service by responding quickly, being personable, and listening to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best way for a client to reach you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to reach out to me through Facebook or by phone or text at (608) 852-5656.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can reach our team directly at any time by phone at (608) 345-6594. You can also email any of us if you have questions. Please also check out our Facebook and Instagram. We look forward to the opportunity to help more people as we continue to grow our team. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you or somebody you know is looking to buy, sell, or invest in real estate in the greater Madison and South Central Wisconsin area, we’d love the opportunity to meet and see if we’re a good match to help you achieve your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Increasing Housing Supply Means to You</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p2To_pELoKo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center; font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Here’s a quick update on the current housing supply situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that housing supply may be on the rise, so what does that mean for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, an important factor in today’s housing market is the number of homes for sale. While inventory levels continue to sit near historic lows, there are indications that we may have hit the lowest point we’ll see and that we’re possibly working our way back up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, inventory was at 2.5 months of supply, which was up from 2.4 in April. That’s a trend we’re seeing on both the national and local levels; &lt;strong&gt;the months’ supply has increased every month since the beginning of the year.&lt;/strong&gt; Though we’re still nowhere near a balanced market (around six months of supply), we are seeing a slow but steady increase in homes for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=More homes for sale mean that buyers have more options and sellers have more competition.%20http://localhost:4000/what-increasing-housing-supply-means-to-you.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“More homes for sale mean that buyers have more options and sellers have more competition.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That has left many buyers and sellers wondering about how this will affect their prospects. &lt;strong&gt;If you’re a buyer, this means that more options are arriving, so now may be the best time to act.&lt;/strong&gt; As the number of homes for sale goes up, the less competition there will be and the less intense the bidding wars will become. If you’ve been struggling to find a home, this news should bring you some hope and motivation to keep looking. Experts have been projecting that mortgage rates may begin to increase toward the end of the year, which will only make purchasing a home a bit less affordable as time passes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a seller in today’s market, now is still a good time to sell. &lt;strong&gt;If you’ve been putting it off, don’t wait much longer.&lt;/strong&gt; This year’s month-over-month gains in the number of homes for sale have helped buyers, but we’re still very much in a seller’s market. More homes are expected to hit the market in the coming months, so selling this summer gives you a chance to get ahead of the competition and maximize your sales potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that more homes for sale mean that buyers have more options and sellers have more competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to buy or sell or if you have any questions about the local market, reach out to us. Let’s connect today so that we can discuss your options.&lt;/p&gt;
