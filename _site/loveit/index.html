		            <p class="testimonial">We had a great experience with the Holt Real Estate team. This was our first time buying a home and werenât sure what to expect or what to look for in a real estate agent. Our lender offered to connect us with an agent who had experience with our loan type (VA loan) and we accepted. Jonathan contacted me within an hour with questions about what we wanted in a home and immediately had us set up into their portal with potential listings. Two days later we found our home, put in an offer, and had it accepted. Home buying can be stressful but the Holt teams was available anytime we had a question or needed guidance. They even met us for an extra showing so our son could see the home. We mostly worked with Jonathan but Joshua was there along the way to answer questions and offer his experience. Savannah sent us weekly updates on where we were at in the process and was quick to respond when I reached out. The Holt team made a very stressful process that much easier and I felt confident that they had my familyâs best interests at heart. We will absolutely use them again in the future.</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">I was renting out a condo that I owned in Stoughton, when my renters decided not to renew their lease I decided it was time to sell my investment property! Originally I had wanted to use a flat fee service and do the majority of the work myself, it was the best way to make the most profit â but when Josh messaged me and asked if I would meet with him I figured it was worth a shot â I know NOTHING about real estate! When we met, he came prepared with lots of paperwork including comparible properties in the area that had sold and a print out showing me the potential profit based on the sale price. The best thing Josh did was provide proof of comparible sales, because he recommended that I list $15,000 MORE than I was intending to list. My property was vacant â Josh held 3 open houses the first weekend it was listed and I accepted an offer of $1500 OVER list price ($16,500 over what I was planning to list at) on the 4th day it was on the market.</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">When I was searching for a new place to live in June, I happened to be put in the capable hands of Joshua at Keller Williams. I was panicked and didnât have much money to buy a place and he constantly reassured me about how he would do anything to help me find a place or with anything Iâd need. The very first day I went looking for a Condo with Joshua, I wanted to see a number of places but figured Joshua had other appointments and would never have time to show me different places. But, I was wrong for Joshua took me to every place I wanted to see and even back to a place we already looked at just to make sure. Well, the place we saw again was what I could afford and we made an offer on it. We even made a lower offer to see if it would be accepted. It was accepted and the ball was rolling. I was then getting more nervous each day as the offer was accepted. Frequently I would get a reassuring call from Joshua calming my fears about finances.</p>

Josh is an amazing realtor. When buying your first home everyone makes the process look so easy from finding the perfect home to getting financing. But that is not at all the experience we had. I think we hit about every bump in the road but Josh was amazing through this process from keeping us posted via phone call or text message to just being there for moral support. Josh was also awesome about meeting on our time. My husband works 2 retail jobs so finding time to meet with Josh sometimes had to be scheduled out and he was so good about getting times that worked for us and working them into his schedule even if it was a phone call while he was driving home at night. No doubt if we decide to sell our house and find a new one we are going with Josh again!!</p>

He would check in every once and awhile just to see how we were and if we had any questions.

We would recommend Josh to anyone trying to sell a house, he's great!!</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">We had a great experience with the Holt Real Estate team. This was our first time buying a home and werenât sure what to expect or what to look for in a real estate agent. Our lender offered to connect us with an agent who had experience with our loan type (VA loan) and we accepted. Jonathan contacted me within an hour with questions about what we wanted in a home and immediately had us set up into their portal with potential listings. Two days later we found our home, put in an offer, and had it accepted.<br> Home buying can be stressful but the Holt teams was available anytime we had a question or needed guidance. They even met us for an extra showing so our son could see the home. We mostly worked with Jonathan but Joshua was there along the way to answer questions and offer his experience. Savannah sent us weekly updates on where we were at in the process and was quick to respond when I reached out. The Holt team made a very stressful process that much easier and I felt confident that they had my familyâs best interests at heart. We will absolutely use them again in the future.</p>

A great realtor and an even better person.</p>

The sales process was handled efficiently with great communication at all times. Josh had a solid marketing plan for each of our properties and listened to any suggestions we had. We feel he had accurate price proposals and were happy with the offers we received. Josh offers a lot of valuable extras with his marketing, including an extensive market analysis, professional staging advice, open houses, great photography and even a home warranty! We would highly recommend Holt Realty.</p>

A 5 star rating doesn't cut it with me, he is beyond that! Victoria Murray handled the bumpy road to keep everything on track and intact right up to closing, I can't thank her enough for her help, as Victoria always says at the end of her emails "Cheers" Thank you!!!</p>

		            <p class="testimonial">We had handled our preceding real estate transactions without an agent, using a real estate lawyer to assist with the proper forms and closing processes. But since those transactions, so much has changed, technologically and certainly with current market conditions. So as we looked to sell our home, we felt that we needed an agent to help us properly market our home, and to help us rank the offers that now contain many more variables than just price. We did our research and interviewed three exceptional agents before selecting Josh. We didnât feel like it would have been a bad decision to go with any of the agents we spoke with. But we also feel like picking Josh was clearly the BEST decision.</p>
